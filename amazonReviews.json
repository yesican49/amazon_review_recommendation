For 40 pounds of cat litter you get AMAZING quality for such a low price with Precious Cat. I absolutely love this litter. Let me start by saying it's natural and it's 100% safe for cats. The soft texture gives cats the perfect place to do their much needed pre-bathroom digging and after-bathroom burying. It's even great for poor declawed cats that develop arthritis and have issues using the litter box. This litter is usually soft enough for cats with those kinds of issues.I've tried a few different kinds of litter. Some have horrible additives (baking soda = no no! That can dry out your poor kitties skin). Others have really strong odors (cats have much more sensitive noses than ours and those strong fragrances can be overwhelming). And then there's the ones with horrible textures that no cat enjoys using the bathroom in.This is a win on all accounts. There are no ridiculous fragrances and no strong additives. It's natural clay litter with a texture that cats ENJOY using. My feline children genuinely get upset when I change their litter box- they don't want me taking this digging stuff away! Of course they're much more grateful when they see I've replaced it with new and cleaner digging stuff. This litter has an amazing ability to block odors. Using it with three cats and changing after about five days- there is virtually no smell in my bathroom. Amazing- very few other litters have accomplished such a feat.It is clumping litter and does it's job very well. I don't sift out the clumps, I simply just change the entire litter box every 5 days. Works fine for me. Some people have complained about pee clumps sticking to the bottom. This only happens with me when I haven't changed the litter often enough and then very large lumps of pee occur and the have no were to go- so they stick to the bottom of the box. A quick way to get rid of them is to use a litter scoop and scrape them off the bottom. Then add just a bit of clean litter, use it as an abrasive to rub the bottom, it will pick up the leftover pee clumps, and then you can dump out that litter- wah lah a clean box!Overall I just LOVE the quality of this stuff! It doesn't stink and my cats LOVE it! I had a small panic attack when I tried to order and it wouldn't ship to Alaska! Luckily that changed about a week later and we're back to ordering more.

There's the easy scoop sandy stuff that clumped well but got stinky fast and tracked everywhere.  Then there were pine pellets which did a great job on urine odor but left a pine stink all over the house and did not clump.  Decided to switch after that to a wheat litter (Swheat Scoop).  That one clumped great and neutralized urine odor pretty well, but the litter itself stank!  And after a few loads of urine, a smell all it's own was created (like rancid flour/puke/stench) that crept along at floor level and would tickle our noses.  It also did not mask fecal odor very well at all and contributed to that rancid smell.  Also dusts significantly and the cat was always doing that cough/wheeze.Enter Dr Elsey's Ultra Precious Cat:  I did not expect much.  It completely destroys urine odor.  The litter is just about scentless and has very low dust (although a little when you pour it in).  The cat is already doing the cough/wheeze much less.  Once he covers the turds, the litter takes care of the odor.  It does track a bit near the box, but I keep a dustbuster nearby for that.  NBD.Gone are the days of walking in the door and being punched in the face by the smell of poo and/or dirty litter stench (or even clean litter as far as pine and wheat are concerned).

I have used brand names and even feline pine and the natural 'corn feed' from the feed n' seed stores.  they all dont hold a candle to this litter.Pros:-very minimal litter scattering.  I am amazed how little litter is tracked outside.  I think this is so b/c the texture of this litter is like the non-clumping clay.  unlike most clumping litter out there, this isnt fine fine granules, nor dust. (only dusty when you pour the litter but very minor compared to other clumping litter out there)-no perfumes.  Hate when companies add this thinking this will mask the stench.  I also hate the thought of my Mocha licking her paws with that perfume too.-no scent. No scent as in no perfume, and as in no stench of feces/pee.  My nose isnt so sensitive but i really dont smell much with this product compared to the rest.  Of course if kitty doesnt bury her poop all the way, you will smell it.  ;)  i've used this one week already (i do get rid of litter everyday) and i dont smell ammonia on the litter box, unlike other brands out there which leave that lingering pee-smell.-clumps nice and hard!  yes, this clumps hard!  love it.

I snip a small part of bag out as to make small opening to pour out the litter (pour it out like cereal....LOL).  in a large litter box, i use about half a bag.-refill litter box often.  something i am kind of noticing with this compared to other fine fine clumping litter is that i have to refill box often with litter.  I'd say i refill about once a week.  I think b/c this litter clumps so hard that it uses more litter that way?  Not a big deal just a little inconvenience i noticed.conclusion:  awesome product.  i wish amazon would consider subscribe and save.  I'd use my free amazon gift cards to get this.  definite re-buy b/c of no perfume, no  urine scent even after one week's use, and clumps beautifully even in the corners making cleaning easy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Believe the hype here!", "unixReviewTime": 1325808000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2012"}

Having three cats, I need a litter that will clump, but other litters will only half clump. Every litter cleaning done with the other brands, I found that urine clumps will fall apart when scooping or some parts are clumped, the other still wet. With this, I can pick up three 'balls' of urine clumps with no breakage or crumbling when putting it into a disposal bag. Even the feces clump! My cats love it (and so do I) because there is no litter trail when they leave their boxes. This litter is cost-effective because of the clumping effectiveness, I do not waste as much litter when refilling. Plus, do the math compared to the weight and cost of name brands. This far outweighs any cat litter on the market.UPDATE 3/18/14: Did an experiment (based on some of the negative reviews) with a pail of TC Multi-Cat & Precious Cat for 1 week. Filled 2 boxes, 1 w/TC, other PC. As I said, PC is more cost effective & cleaner than other 'clumping' litters. TC had dust, left paw trails & wedged into kitty paws. PC little dust, no trails & no wedgies. On day 3, of 2-a-day cleanings (definitely not the norm for me, only an experiment), the TC pail had less than 1/4 left, and I used less than 1/4 of PC. Why do I like this? My cats are diggers & if they can't bury their business or have room for more, they will knock the clumps out of their boxes, creating a mess for me to clean. With PC it clumps so tight they can move the clumps to the sides and have plenty of room. Less trail mess, less refilling of boxes, and less time for me to clean the boxes because of urine clumps breaking. I have not had a problem with odor as others wrote and, as a matter of fact, I always bought scented litter and with PC I see no difference in odor control.

I didn't want a heavily scented litter, so I went with this one instead of the Ultra Scented Multicat in the purple bag. Granted, I've never tried the purple bag formula, but I don't like the way scented litter just masks odors.To reiterate what I wrote in my R&R; review, I needed a low-dust litter and found that most people went with either World's Best or Precious Cat. I used World's Best for a while and I loved the litter itself, but I didn't love the price tag. After a few months on R&R;, I decided to never look back. I love that I don't have to sacrifice quality to save money on the equivalent of toilet paper for cats. I have a black litter mat in front of the box and tile floors, so it's easy for me to see (and feel, because I walk around barefooted) if it's actually working or not. Dust and tracking is pretty much as nonexistent as you can get with 4 very curious and rambunctious kittens.My kitty is pretty chill so she didn't have a problem with the switch and the kittens went straight from their non-clumping to this one without any litter-munching issues (at first, I kept a layer of non-clumping litter on top of the Precious Cat litter, just in case, though). I don't think there's too much difference between this one and R&R; besides the lack of herbal essences. I haven't had any issues with odors unless the kittens forget to cover their poo. The only thing I've had a problem with is that it seems to have a few clumping issues when the description clearly states that this litter &#34;prevents moisture from reaching the bottom of the litter box, while providing a clump that will not break apart&#34;. Maybe it's just because the litter boxes have so much traffic or maybe I'm not using enough litter, but moisture does reach the bottom, resulting in a bunch of cement blobs. I have to really scrape with the scoop to get them off and the clumps break apart in the process. Mild annoyance = -1 star. I haven't tried any other brands because I trusted Precious Cat to deliver, so I don't really have anything to compare to.

After years of using regular, non-clumping clay litter preferred by three older indoor/outdoor cats, I got tired of constantly hauling it from the store for my current brood, three young indoor-only cats. I decided to start trying clumping litters and PRECIOUS CAT ULTRA PREMIUM CLUMPING CAT LITTER was the second brand I tested. I love it, and the cats prefer it, too.Pros- No dust!- HARD clumping. The first clumping litter I tried created fragile clumps that tended to break apart when I shook the scooper to separate the clump from the clean litter. Although I haven't tried it, I think I could play stickball with these clumps. :-)- The litter is unscented (I hate the perfume-y smell of some clumping litters), but does a great job of controlling odor with my one-scoop-per-day habit.- Minimal tracking. This was a problem with the first clumping litter I tried. The cats tracked it all over the house. With this litter, the \"grains\" are heavy enough that they tend not to cling to cat fur.- The cats love it. I had one box with this litter sitting next to a box with the non-clumping litter for over a month. The cats began using this litter more and more and the non-clumping litter less and less. By the end of the day, the PRECIOUS box would be too full of waste while the non-clumping litter was barely used. Even though I wasn't quite finished with the last bag of non-clumping litter, I got rid of it and put this litter in both boxes. From day one, the cats began to use both boxes equally.Cons- For me, the only con is the packaging. A 40-pound bag of this litter is actually smaller than the 25-pound bag of non-clumping litter I used, and it lasts much longer. But it is difficult for me to carry from the store to the car to the house. The slick plastic bag the litter comes packaged in doesn't help. I don't want to pay the high shipping charges for this product, and I can't find the smaller 18-pound unit at the store. It's definitely not a deal-breaker, and in fact, the litter's density is probably responsible for its hard-clumping, non-tracking traits. It's just something to note.Second time's a charm, and my clumping litter tests are over.

If you have a preference for clay and clumping litters, you can't do better than this. If you use an automated litter box, like the litter maid brands, you should really consider switching over because this litter is going to hold up so much better to that mechanical arm than other brands. Even if you don't have one of those, and you use clay based litters, you should still switch over right away!Cleaning out litter, which is always the least pleasant part of owning an indoor cat, was made so much easier when we made the switch to Dr. Elsey's. Now, there's no need to worry about clumps breaking as you're scooping or inhaling litter dust as you clean out the kitty's box. The low dust baseline is also excellent for your cat, and a must if you have a kitty with respiratory problems. This is an unscented, clay litter which is great, as it wont turn off cats from using it (due to their much more highly developed sense of smell, cats are often offended by scented litters). If you did want something to absorb the odors a bit better, you could always sprinkle a little bit of baking soda on the litter after you clean it out and add more.So now, what used to take so much time because you had to be so incredibly careful in scooping, lest you break up clumps, cleans up in just a minute or two. This litter's also cut back drastically on how often I need to toss out the entire box of litter, saving on money. Because the clumps don't break up, there's no real residue or broken, stray pieces dirtying up the remaining litter. As a result, the litter really doesn't need to be changed all the frequently. From what used to be a weekly thing, now it's a once a month chore. And if you're really diligent about regular, daily box cleanup, and maintain a sufficient height of litter (~3.5-4 inches) you could probably even get away with not tossing it ever (see amazing online articles on litter and litter boxes by Vet, Lisa A. Pierson on catinfo.org).I've also noticed less tracking, I think because it's such a dense litter, though some still occurs. I think that's just the nature of clumping litter though and easily addressed with a good mat or tray in front of the litter box entrance.Honestly, there's not enough good things to say about this litter. I've found it to be great for my cats and the foster home my last kitty came from also used this brand and they had some 10 cats living there. They swore by this litter and couldn't rave enough about it. I strongly recommend switching, if you're even slightly considering it!

They lost their clumping ability over time, and even new boxes were extremely dusty and it only got worse as time went on. I figured this was just the way clumping cat litters worked. But then my cat began to lose most of the hair on his belly and I wondered if maybe the perfumes and dust in his litter were compelling him to overgroom. I did a lot of research and decided to try this litter to see if it would help.I know it sounds silly to say that my eyes were opened to a whole new world of cat litter, but they were! The first thing I noticed was how much less dust there was. There was a little bit, but nothing compared to the noxious clouds that come from Tidy Cats or Fresh Step. It clumps incredibly well, and doesn't turn to dust over time. Not only does this help you keep the box cleaner, but the clumping also helps reduce how much litter is tracked outside. Of course, there is still some litter that escapes the box, but much less than before.I'm extremely happy with the odor control too. It has no perfume smell at all. Despite this, I never notice a smell from the litterbox unless I actually stick my face into it. Since it's not perfumed, the clumped clay smells faintly like, well, wet clay when it's been used. Some people might be put off by the different smell but I find it much better than heavy perfume.My cat used to obsessively wipe his paws on the floor and the wall for 5-10 minutes at a time after using his box, and I figured it was just a weird quirk of his, but after switching to this product, he now wipes them maybe five times and then stops. I feel awful about how dirty he must have felt while using the old litter. Best of all, his fur is finally starting to grow back!I highly recommend spending a few more dollars to get a litter that's not only more convenient for you, but better for your cat.

The urine sometimes sticks to the bottom of both my cat's cat boxes and is like scrapping off sticky wet cement.  I used Scoop Away,  Tidy Cat and a Wal-Mart boxed brand that acted like Scoopable before and those 3 products did not wetly cling to the bottom of the cat box.  Those litters must absorb the wet quickly and not settle on the bottom and harden.  You cannot just easily scoop out the urine clumps because they have to be seriously scrapped off the bottom of the box which takes time and is gross and never comes completely off.  Also as the scooper scrapes the urine soaked lumps off off bottom of pan, the clumps fall apart spreading their stench amongst the clean litter and the clumps are now too small to scoop out.  Both my cats' litter pans are very very deep and filled high with litter because I have a cat that digs and if the litter is shallow, he leaves his bundles of joy uncovered.

It smelled more like grocery store cat food than other high-end kibbles I've bought. The cats seem to like it fine, though not all of them were crazy about it. I think part of that is because this food is crunchier than what they had before. They are all used to it now, but I think they may prefer their other food. This is a pretty good deal, though, so I will probably alternate this with other brands.If you're looking for a higher-end, nutritious cat kibble at a pretty good price this definitely isn't a bad choice.

I was really afraid one of them was dying, but many comments said the vet had no idea what it was.  While trying to figure out what the problem was I stumbled upon all of the info on how bad most of the big brand dry cats food are and all of the nasty stuff that's in them - including euthanized animals (ew!).  Apparently, the best thing for cats is real meat but I have my cats on a timed feeder which is awesome and they don't hunt me down for every meal.  So, I compromised and switched to one feeding of wet (Friskies) and went looking for a good dry because I just can't commit to being stalked all the time when they want to be fed.  Chicken Soup was pretty highly rated and not as expensive as the very top brands - although I think it's still pretty expensive at $28+ a bag (and it started out as a prime item - that helped).  Anyway, the food is pretty big and \"X\" shaped which did concern me because my cats were used to much smaller bits.  They did transition to it well and the throwing up stopped immediately - and they rarely throw up at all now.  I would say after a few months they started to lose interest and were leaving a lot in the feeder every day.  I would usually cover the wet with it at dinner and then they would finish it.  Not sure if they are just getting old and it was too tough on their teeth or not, but I switched to the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon and they gobbled that right down.

So went to the highest end food Evo which costs about twice as much as Chicken Soup.  While it is really a high-quality food I started noticing that my cats just gulp down the kibble without chewing.  The kibble is too small for adult cats.  This causes 2 problems: bad for tooth and gum health if they dont chew, and eating too fast which can cause vomiting.  So I went thru small batches of about 8 premium brands looking for a good sized kibble.  None of them qualified until I found Chicken Soup.  The kibble is X shape - not round like the rest - which kind of forces them to chew.  Ingredients look fine.  Price is actually reasonable compared to the others.  So I have been feeding it about a year now.  The only thing I can say negative is, like some others have noted, that it causes loose stools in my 11 year old cat.

They gave him some medication, recommended dietary changes, and suggested getting a new litterbox with different litter, because even once the symptoms cleared up, the cat would probably still have negative associations with his old boxes.I picked this up at the pet store because I was desperate to get him to stop pooping on the carpet ASAP. It's possible any new litter would have done the trick. But thankfully, this worked. I still have his two old litterboxes, with his old brand of litter, which he will deign to pee in, but he will only poop in the new box with the Cat Attract litter. After months of pooping everywhere but the litterbox, he used the new one, with this litter, almost as soon as I put it in, and has used it consistently ever since. I bought a second bag on Amazon because the price, even with Prime shipping, was about the same as the pet store, and it was more convenient to have it delivered.My biggest complaint--and the reason I've kept the old litter around too--is that it clumps a little too well. Before, I was using the World's Best Cat Litter brand, which is corn-based, and which does a very good job of sticking to itself without sticking to the box or the scoop. Cat Attract is incredibly sticky when wet; it has the consistency of freshly poured concrete and it sticks to the scoop and the bottom of the litter box a little better than it sticks to itself, so scooping up after pee is a bit of a hassle. My plastic scooper bends  when I force it against a clump; I have to dig at it with the corner of the scoop, as that's the most structurally sound angle. Then I have to wipe out all the little crevices in the scoop with a paper towel. I've found that the problem can be partly ameliorated by sprinkling a thin layer of baking soda on the bottom of the litter box before putting in the litter; that keeps it from sticking to the box as much. I would also recommend a metal scoop.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worked on my cat, I but wish it weren't so sticky!", "unixReviewTime": 1376179200, "reviewTime": "08 11, 2013"}

I tried Earth's Best Cat litter and it worked beautifully.  However, I decided that I wanted to move the litter box and I wanted to make certain that kitty didn't revert to old habits. I added a second box in the spot where I wanted the litter box to be while initially keeping the old box where it was.  I used Cat Attract in the new box as I wanted to make sure that kitty really took notice of the new litter box.  It worked perfectly. Kitty was immediately attracted to and curious about the new box.  In fact, he loves Cat Attract so much that he sort of abandoned the old box.  Problem is that Cat Attract is difficult to locate locally and it is a little bit of a pain to have to order the litter online because it is difficult to arrange for someone to be home for delivery.  Also, Cat Attract is expensive!  Whereas 7 lbs of Earth's Best lasts a really long time, I ran through almost 20lbs of Cat Attract in a week.  It seems more compact than other litters.  I am still scratching my head as to why this should be so.

Suitcases, area rugs and bathmats, plastic or bubble wrap, nylon fabric, athletic shoes and flip flops were his favorite things to pee on. A few years ago we rescued two kittens and his issues got even worse. He hated sharing any of the three boxes we have and didn't even like using \"his\" box when he had already used it once before. I just couldn't clean the boxes out frequently enough, especially when I wasn't home. He also started pooping on the floor beside the litter box. This was an almost daily occurence. Over the years I have tried several of the eco-friendly litters. Feline Pine eventually made my house smell like a damp wood shop, scattered everywhere, and sometimes I would get a splinter in my foot from it. World's Best is corn based and smelled like a farm and my cats hated it. Swheat Scoop was OK -- until I got a few bags infested with moths. I was desperate to find a new litter, even it wasn't environmentally the best choice. I just wanted something that all my cats would use and controlled odors without an overwhelming perfumed scent. Last week I bought two bags of Precious Cat and replaced all the litter with it. I know it's best to introduce a new litter gradually, but I decided it was do or die time, so to speak. They all seemed very interested at first and just started by smelling. Over the next 24 hours they all began testing it out. It has now been one week and I am thrilled to report there has not been a single accident or present left outside the box! This morning I even discovered the old cat using one of the boxes normally used by the other cats. I have never seen him use it before, and it had been used several times before he hopped into it. That is just unbelievable after all these years and problems. Life has gotten a lot easier for all of us thanks to Precious Cat! It is worth the price!!!Update 11/11/11: The success has continued to be impressive overall. I have been buying this locally at Petco for $21.99. Stopped in Petsmart today and discovered they are selling it for $14.99 a bag! Guess where I am shopping from now on?! Petsmart does sell a stainless steel litter box, if you are looking for something besides plastic. It has a modern look, very high sides, rubber feet and is $24.99. They also sell the herbal mix that you can sprinkle in, I got some to add in for boost of encouragement. We had a minor relapse recently with our old cat when house guests disrupted his routine. I am hoping that the stainless steel litter box, the herbal mix and some coaxing will get him back on track. Even with his current issue, he is still using the box more frequently thanhe ever did before I switched to Precious Cat. It has really made a huge difference for our household.I would like to address a few comments left by other reviewers. I was skeptical about the dustless claims. I am sure there is some dust eventually, but I haven't seen it. No dust cloud when you pour or sift through the box. I completely agree with comments about the smell of the litter. There is virtually no smell to the litter itself, other than a faint herb smell that is almost undetectable unless I am inches from it. Odor control of cat waste is excellent, especially if the waste is covered by the cat. Tracking is minimal and stays close to the box. I used to find Feline Pine and Swheat Scoop on my couch, in my bed, everywhere. Precious Cat clumps very hard, but the longer it sits the better. One of my cats pees in a line pattern, so his clumps break up more than the others. And sometimes it does stick to the box. However, if I tip the box and gently bang on the outside of it, the clump will disloge without breaking and I can easily scoop it up. There is no such thing as perfect, but this litter is a lifesaver for our household.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Magic in a bag and worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1312156800, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2011"}

So I switched to the same brand (precious cat), for about the same price with twice the litter. To keep my cat using I mix the kitten attract in with the less expensive.

Now that she is getting older, having a pulling puppy seems to be very hard on her when they walk, so I decided to get this gentle lead for her, since I had great experience with this lead, when my Newfoundland was a young ball of energy. Everyone was complementing on how she would take me on walks.This lead did wonders, worked like a charm. It was almost funny to see her and what the lead would do. Every time she would try to pull, her face would turn to her side so she ends up looking back, then she couldn't walk forward. It would stop her immediately.The lead may take time for some dogs to adjust to, just because it goes over the muzzle.With my Newfoundland she did not like the lead on her face and she would try to take it off while walking sometimes but eventually she did get used to it.For some you may have to be very patient, but you will get there. If anyone is wondering will it hurt your dog? No it will not. it really is gentle on you and your dog.Best product I have ever used for pulling dogs, stops them before they can even pull.If your dog is a squirmish I also recommend having a additional regular collar on for back up,(HOLDING IT VERY LOOSLEY SO THE LEAD CAN DO IT'S JOB) in case of slip offs (sometimes it does happen) until you know it's OK.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best for pulling dogs", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2014"}

There are remnants of more than a dozen dog toys scattered around his Igloo.  The first thing he did when he got this was try to destroy it.

I am not as fond as he is of that old Kong.  He wants to play tug-o-war with it, but it's too darn close to those power-chewer teeth for me.  This Hurley is perfect.Over the past month, he has managed to get another scrap loose from this thing.  But I wouldn't dream of returning it.  He is happy with it.  He goes through toys so fast that he doesn't have anything familiar from one day to the next.  After a month, this is practically his binkie.  He takes its with him wherever he goes.

This dog is Mr. Destructo and he can chew his way through anything! However, he hasn't been able to destroy the Hurley. He loves it so much we bought another so he can have one outside. We also bought him aWest Paw Bumi.I originally bought the Hurley because of the guarantee. If your dog destroys a West Paw brand toy, they will replace it. I felt like I would at least not be totally wasting my money if it succumbed to my dog's aggressive chewing. It turns out I haven't ever needed to send it back as it's been almost a year and the thing looks practically new despite being \"well loved\".The neat thing about the Hurley is that it's got a little give to the material and yet it doesn't puncture (at least ours hasn't). Our dog enjoys chewing on it and you don't ever hear that scraping sound on his teeth like you would a \"real\" bone. Sometimes we do hear a little \"squeak squeak squeak\" sound when he nibbles on the little ridges on the ends.Another great thing is that this bone FLOATS. We took it with us to the local reservoir when we taught our dog to swim. You can toss it out in the water and it bobs up to the surface. We tied a rope to ours to make it easier to pull back in. During last summer threw it into the kiddy pool in the backyard and our dog was in heaven splashing around to retrieve it. I think it was extra fun for him since it doesn't sink to the bottom but instead rides the crest of the waves and splashes he makes in the pool.While the West Paw Bumi is his favorite toy, he does love the Hurley bone and gets it when he wants a good chew. Sometimes he tosses it around, probably because it bounces a little when it hits the ground and for whatever reason he thinks that's pretty fun. ;-)I highly recommend you giving the Hurley a try if you are looking for a sturdy toy that is rugged and can withstand heavy chewing. I've really gotten my money's worth out of this toy since I haven't had to replace it and it's still looking good (not all ratty and nasty like some dog toys can get).One last comment: When his Hurley from outside has gotten dirty over time, I've just brought it in the house and given it a quick wash in the sink and it comes out looking great again.

I have my dogs shaved down several times in the warmer months so going to the groomers gets costly quickly. This is a very quiet clipper so it didn't bother my dogs at all. It did a good job of clipping them but it does get somewhat bogged down on really heavy coats, which is why I gave it a \"4\" and not a \"5\". One of our Rotties has a super heavy coat and it took almost an hour of working through her hair to get it trimmed properly. Not complaining, its a whole lot cheaper than taking them to the groomers, but just be prepared for a little slow going with really thick coats. My dogs have short hair and I used a #3 blade on them and it gave a nice clip that wasn't too short. The blade got hot after about 10 minutes or so of use, but the Andis Coolant did a quick job of cooling it. In retrospect, I suggest that you spend a few extra dollars and get the ceramic blade which stays much cooler. Be sure to oil your blade and let the clipper run for about 10 minutes prior to use to avoid snagging and pulling. The clipper itself is well weighted in your hand and not difficult to use at all.

I simply turn it off for a few minutes and while taking a little break from the grooming, comfort the dog.  It is important to not only oil the blades but to clean them out completely of little hairs that become entrapped.  I use a little stiff brush and even follow up with the blow dryer.

The cutting motion is consistent and makes easy work of long hair and heavy undercoat. We don't have to make several passes over the same area like we did with prior clippers. I like that the noise level is so much lower than that of other models we've tried, as it helps keep our dog relaxed. I do wish the cord were longer, but that is a small inconvenience.

For whatever reason, here at Amazon this combination is available in a multiplicity of model numbers based on included accessories and also many different vendors. The vendor for this review appears to have linked it to a slightly different clipper which appears to have the same body but a ceramic blade.  The Ceramic blade should in theory stay sharper longer than a stainless blade but I can't speak to it's performance on fine hair as I haven't tried it.Original review below:Animals vary greatly in temperment so if you can borrow a friends clipper to try on your animal first I recommend it before making the investment. We have two cats so this clipper more or less paid for itself the first year in use.We tried my sister's animal clipper the first year. The second year we tried two from Target and one from Petsmart. Finally bit the bullet and got this one from Petsmart. Pricier than the first we bought from them but worth it. (They were kind enough to let us return the first one)In hindsight, if we had the option of buying the clipper only we would have as we don't need all the combs, and if you don't need the extras you can get the clipper by itself for a lot less. The black plastic molded case ours came with is very convenient, however.Be careful when buying this clipper - the actual model of the clipper is MBG2 and it comes with a #10 blade. THERE ARE TWO ANDIS \"PET PRO\" CLIPPERS and the other one (The body is shorter, without the swoopy curve on the handle) doesn't get very good reviews.Himalayan cats are like Persians and have massive amounts of extremely fine hair.

It helps to keep some tension on their skin with the other hand.

Even though it is expensive, we think it is worth the price.For me, the secret is in the clumping - better than with any other product I have tried over the almost 25 years that I have had cats. It remains a clump and does not fall apart like so many other litter brands do if you remove it too soon or too late. It does not matter whether it is fresh pee or you are cleaning the litter box hours \"after the deed\" - the litter forms a firm clump and even shaking it on the scoop in order to get excess litter to fall back into the pan keeps the clump intact. Very neat and very economical, too, because no product is wasted.Odor control is very satisfactory. We have three cats and do not notice any bad smells. We think, in fact, this litter performs better than other brands in this department. No obnoxious artificial scenting needed.Lastly, I prefer the color and consistency of this litter to the regular greyish litter. The particles are smaller, grainier, kind of like coarse sand, and although it sounds weird I must say that cleaning the litter box is not as appalling when the color is sand-like. The old grey stuff always put me off more...:-)Although the price seems high, I feel that this is a great natural product with a lot of real benefits (like it lasting quite long) and would recommend it to anyone with cats.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1205971200, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2008"}

I have tried absolutely everything in my quest to find a silica free cat litter that isn't loaded with perfumes and that works well.  I think that World's Best delivers on their promises.  It clumps beautifully, is flushable, is not harmful to breathe, and is not harmful to my cats when they clean themselves.  A lot of people complain that this has absolutely NO odor control.  I don't agree, but you MUST clean your litter box AT LEAST once a day.  The heavily perfumed clay litters may be more forgiving with regard to daily cleanings, but really....do you want your cats to scratch around in a box filled with poop and urine for days on end??  They will track that all over your house!  People also complain about the price, but guess what?  That cheap clay litter throws off silica dust that YOU AND YOUR CATS breathe in.  Look up \"silicosis\" and then rethink using clay litters.  I've also tried pine litter and that stuff tracks all over the house and is a royal pain to clean up...and talk about no odor control.  Same problem with newspaper litter:  stinky.  Arm and Hammer has a \"natural\" pine litter that I recently tried and it was so strongly perfumed, it smelled like someone dumped a bottle of Pine-Sol into the litter box....that was the only time my cats ever refused to use their box due to a litter change and the couple of times they did urinate into the Arm and Hammer pine litter it REEKED of ammonia.  It was awful.  I know better now...I won't be changing brands again any time soon.So now I have been using World's Best for almost a year and I feel like it has great odor control as long as I clean it daily.  It has been my experience that once the litter gets stinky despite vigilant scooping, it is time to change it out for completely fresh litter.Great product, but people seriously need to develop better scooping habits.

Allergies are completely a individual matter so I can not say this product doesn't work.

The website says, dogs who suffer from some health conditions, can be exacerbated by eating sweet potatoes or white potatoes. Because white potatoes and sweet potatoes are high in carbohydrates and sugar, they can aggravate canine candida. White potatoes feed yeast, and this can cause or intensify yeast infections and sweet potatoes are problematic as they have more naturally occurring estrogen than white potatoes.

Within a few weeks he was covered in bumps from head-to-toe, his hair fell out, he wheezed horribly, had really bad gas, went to the bathroom a lot and had loose stools.  I wasn't sure he would live, and the Vet said he had severe allergies, probably to his food, and put him on several months of prednisone and a prescription allergy food.  I was upset with the prednisone treatment as I knew it was dangerous and my dog hated the prescription food.  Two weeks later there was almost no change and he was still miserable, so I started researching my own solution for allergies, comparing food ingredients, and ideas to try.  I found that salmon/fish and sweet potatoes are not ingredients found in many other dog foods so an allergy to them would be more rare...and this food doesn't contain any grains or poultry products.  I started him on this and added a heaping spoon of canned pink salmon with it, and he still licks the bowl clean every time.  His breathing started clearing up within a week or so and I was able to stop giving him prednisone.  The bumps gradually went away after about a month and a half and his hair slowly grew back.  It took about 4+ months for 100% of his symptoms to go away, but he has been doing great for over a year now.  (For treats he is only allowed raw baby carrots, apple chunks, frozen green beans, or salmon jerky.)This food is an excellent option for dogs with both grain and poultry allergies as I can't seem to find another quality dog food that doesn't contain a little bit of chicken or rice, eggs, oatmeal, etc.  My only issue is that it is a bit low on protein, but since I add canned salmon to his food each day anyway isn't a problem for us.  The canned salmon and salmon oil are good for his skin so it works nicely, especially since he will eat the dry dog food just fine, but when I add the canned salmon he goes nuts for it.If your dog has allergies, try this!!  Don't let the vet sell you prescription dog food and put your dog on dangerous doses of prednisone.  My vet put my dog on the most common one sold; it was really expensive and I was so upset after I researched it and discovered that it has almost zero nutritional value.

Since switching, my pup has consistently good stool in the morning and afternoon, but for some reason by early evening, his stool is still soft (although not a runny as when he was on Blue Buffalo).

Which leads me to #3.  You need to feed almost twice the amount of food for growing puppies (probably to make up for the lower levels of protein).

He wasn't fond of his old food (I think it was Iams large breed puppy) but he would eat most of it after a while. This one, I even tried adding water (nope), broth (he'd lap up any liquid, ignored food per usual if there wasn't excess liquid), and canned food (tried his best to eat around the dried food) and withholding food for several hours until I knew he'd be hungry. The best I got was a few small mouthfuls a day, when he had been eating about 1 1/2 cups of the previous food a day. He would always act starved (we even had some behavior issues with him grabbing food from the kids which he hadn't done while eating Iams) so I gave in and started adding canned food. I would not buy this again, it's unfortunately not such a great deal when you have to add canned food on top of it.The only upside, and the reason it's not a one star, is his coat while we were going through all of this became noticeably softer and more shiny.

I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD!

I assumed all bully's were the same.  I have purchased several different brands from several stores.  All have been virtually identical in size both length and diameter from store to store.  Additionally, I have never notice any overly strong smell to go with those bully's either.We received the bully's (it was delivered to my office) the smell was so strong I had to take it out to my car.  That was a horrible idea.  My car ended up smelling horrible despite the box being in my trunk.  I almost threw up from the smell; luckily I have a 10 minute drive.  When I got home I pulled a bully out of the package.  It was thinner than I had ever seen before.  I took a closer look at the bag and was surprised to the differences in sizes within the bag.  I assumed it would not last as long as the normal sticks we get because of the diameter but it was twice as long as I normally buy so I thought that might even out.  I was wrong.  She had it finished in less than 15 minutes instead of the usual 2-5 days.  Well about 3 hours later she started getting sick.  I research a bit and found out that poorly processed bully sticks can be loaded with bacteria.  Our dog has been sick for 3 days as a result of the single bully stick.  I should have know based on the smell.  We are converting to dried sweet potatoes.  Those don't make her sick.Bacterial contamination information relating to Bully or Pizzle sticks: The researchers further found that 27 percent of the bully sticks were contaminated with Escherichia coli (E. coli), with at least one stick contaminated with an antibiotic-resistant strain. Another stick was contaminated with Clostridium difficile, and another contained the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).The findings emphasize the need for people to wash their hands after handling any pet treats made from raw meat, the researchers said.

I don't think I need toput any treats inside it for her, she seems to like it so much, but once in a while to surprise her I might!+++++UPDATE: Well my little dog absolutely still loves this toy, but as suspected, she quickly chewed pieces offon the ends where the stuffing treats go, so, I have to limit her time with it.  She likes the texture of it,so, now I have to find one that has the same rubbery texture, but maybe not the open holes on the ends, so shecan chew away but not into pieces.

The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used.To begin with, it is difficult to \"load\" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy.Bottom line: I feel that this toy is difficult to fill, and can only be used for \"treat gorging\" and not for regular dinner time. If your fingers are less delicate than mine and you just want a treat ball, you may like this - my dog certainly likes the chewy rubber and he hasn't destroyed it yet (although he's not much of a chewer).

I broke the treats into small pieces that fell out of the holes easily, which motivated him to keep trying for the other larger pieces that eventually disintegrate due to drool.One liver biscotti (size of a regular biscotti), cracked and put into this ball, can keep him occupied for an hour or two, easily.I was trying to find a way to keep him occupied for longer and cheaper than his all time favorites, bully sticks (which even online are getting mighty expensive lately).Amazingly, when given a choice now between the \"biscotti ball\" or the bully stick, he'll choose the ball.By the way, this dog can chew, and the ball hasn't broken for me yet.

She also gets either raw food or cooked meat and veggies for dinner, so I basically use this as a fun time toy on the weekends.  The brand of kibble I use (Nature's Variety) is small, so it is easy to fill and does come out somewhat easy, but it still takes her time to get it all out.  She is 30 pounds and I did buy the large size.  She likes teeny tiny toys or big toys.  This one she likes to carry by putting her teeth inside the hole (without kibble in it).I am going to purchase one of these for my mom's dog.  She has trouble getting him to eat a lot of the time.  When he comes to my house and \"Jelly Ball\" comes out, he gets excited.  However, my dog won't let him do the rolling.  He has to stay behind and try to snag any kibble she overlooks.  He's only 13 pounds, but I will probably also get him the large size.I'm very happy with this ball.  I have had it for well over 2 years, and you can't even see any marks on it.

(If you read all my reviews, you'll see a bunch of them, but I have a bunch more.)  This toy is by far the easiest one to get the treats out of unless you invest in some seriously large treats. Even my dog that usually struggles to figure out how to dispense the treats can empty this ball quickly.  In truth, that's usually why I put it in circulation. Sometimes I feel bad that he can't figure out the other toys. Although this ball seems relatively sturdy, a tough chewer could probably still chew it open if s/he wanted to. I don't think that would happen just to get the treats out though, as they'll dispense easily enough on their own. If you're looking for a more challenging toy of this genre, I'd go with the blue Everlasting Treat Toy over this green Everlasting Fun Ball.  Due to the flat sides of the blue treat toy, it usually ends up stuck under my couch less frequently than this ball, too, which tends to roll into numerous complicated spots for the dogs to retrieve on their own. If you're looking for a ball to dispense dry kibble, this one won't work, as the holes are far too large. For that purpose, I'd suggest the larger, orange Tricky Treat Ball by another manufacturer. In short, this is a fun, but easy toy for dispensing treats.

I slice them thinly for training, so that he doesn't get too satiated in training and so that his weight won't become unhealthy. I really didn't need any new treats for training, and certainly not these treats that work out to almost a dollar an ounce! But we recently bought the Everlasting Fun Treat Ball and found out, after it arrived, that our regular treats would not fit in the new ball. These treats were recommended for filling the ball. I hate to throw good money after bad, but I thought maybe these would be a fun enough diversion that it would be a worthwhile treat for the puppy, so I went ahead and bought some.The good news is that these treats do fit in the Everlasting Fun ball - almost as if the ball were made with these treats in mind! The treats slide in between the \"teeth\" of the ball opening easily, and the teeth don't catch at the treat (and my fingers) as they had in previous attempts to fill the ball. The treats are also very pretty, the different colors and flavors are neat for us humans to look at. The bad news is that the colors and flavors seem lost on my puppy, who much prefers his Omega ball, with its puppy kibble and occasional freeze-dried liver piece. He'll play with the Everlasting Fun treat ball and these treats if I give it directly to him, but when left to his own devices, he'll go back to his liver-laced kibble. I was expecting these treats to be exciting enough to hold his interest, but he seems kind of bored with them, and he seems to eat the treats more because they are there and less because they entice him - definitely not like the four or five other types of treats we use.This 5 oz. bag will fill our Everlasting Fun ball at least twice and maybe three times, but the ball is small enough that this isn't terribly impressive.

Rawhide sticks (all colors and flavors, not just green ones), Greenies, Dingos, CET and also use some rawhide bones.  These treats help scrape plaque from their teeth while chewing before tarter can form if given after meals or once a day.  My dogs do not get soft food or treats unless we are training.  Saving soft treats for training makes them want it all the more and the hard food is better for their teeth and digestion.I have a Miniature Pinscher and 2 Pomeranians that are prone to tooth loss so taking care of their teeth is very important to me.  My oldest Pomeranian is 6 years old and just had his first professional cleaning and that was mainly because it is hard for me to get his back teeth because his mouth is so tiny.They love when they see the bag of treats come out of the cupboard because they now it's the soft stuff or the small one bite treats and they are more receptive to training and their sessions go much faster.I would recommend these treats as part of a variety.

Thank goodness I did. I have one bubbler and two airstones which I wanted a steady current of bubbles emitting from them. This pump provides just enough air to serve my purposes, but the airflow is not firm enough to create a true bubble curtain with all 3 bubbler accessories running.  Even with only one accessory attached the flow is barely what I would call a bubble curtain. Its still a decent pump though, and the current airflow is more to my fishes liking.As far as noise level goes, this pump does make a hum, similar to the old computers of the floppy disk era. It's noticeable without some moderate white noise, but its no where near the drone of the 747 landing strip sounds the old pumps used to make. Unless you are listening for it, you likely won't even notice its there.The pump has rubber feet which keep it from wobbling around and may also help to deaden the sound a bit. There is only one air output on this one, but the box does include one T splitter. The pump also does not have an off switch, so if you are using for a purpose other than an aquarium, take that into account.  If you are planning on using lots of accessories (which require multiple airlines) you probably should invest in a pump with more than one output (again, this only has one). Or, if loss of airflow isn't an issue you can get a gang valve or some more splitters to connect your extra lines. Make sure to get a decent gang valve or check valves in case of power outage to protect your pump from back flow. Remember, every split off the main line will lessen your airflow with each addition.For now, this pump will suit my purposes. It seems built fairly well as pumps go.

Fig.", "helpful": [57, 57], "reviewText": "Let's get something clear first, no air pump runs 100% quiet, no matter what the manufacturer says. Now the review :After all the numerous mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance and get this air pump anyway, and I'm glad I did.This pump, as the title says, is surprisingly quiet, the sound of the bubbles and the waves in my tank are actually louder than this pump, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. I have an old, square shape, Aquaculture pump that was bugging me it was so loud. The Tetra Whisper pump emits a very,  almost unnoticed hum. The pump has 2 outakes and comes included with the following:The pump of course, instructions , 1T-adapter; 2 knobs/valves that  help regulate the amount of bubbles you feed into the aquarium by increasing/decreasing air flow. This is actually perfect for those like me with a smaller tank,  even though I have a 50 GAL, I don't have to have bubbles at full blast.I had a problem with my wave maker stirring bubbles all over the place, but now with this new pump, I can have less bubbles in the area near the powerheads hooked  to my wave maker. I'm currently using this pump with these:Elite 1-Inch Cylinder Air Stone, 4-Packand so far, so good. Let the stones soak in your tank for at least 10 minutes before using them.Some people recomend keeping the pump above water level, but in my 12 years of keeping aquariums I've never done that; just make sure you create a \"drip loop\" for the power cord with a screw or a push pin, so if water for some reason finds its way down, it will hang and drip at the loop and not reach the AC plug. You may also want to get these:2 PCS Non-return Check Valves for Aquarium Air Pumpto keep water from going into the pump during water changes or power outages.If you ask me if I have any complaints about this pump,  I'd say its size, but that's a minor issue for me, the dome shape of the pump was intentionally designed to reduce the amount of noise it makes, and it works.The pump measurements are as follow:7.5 inches long, 4.5 inches wide and 3 inches high.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase, the pump is well built, high quality and made to last. The best feature of course, its almost silent operation, I don't have to crank the volume up on my TV anymore.One last tip, if you want this pump, or any other pump to make less noise, place it on top of a thick sock or an old fashioned mouse pad. That should absorb some of the vibrations.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surprisingly Quiet. Good Quality & Parts.", "unixReviewTime": 1328745600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2012"}

I wish the manufacturers would list these units by flow rate instead of tank size ....tank size means very little to me. I was a medical equipment technician once, so I decided to do a flow rate test on the whisper units I own and here is what I found:60 Gal: 2.3 LPM on one side and 2.2 LPM on the other side, for a combined total of 5.5 LPM40 Gal: 1.7 LPM10-30 Gal: 1.0 LPM I was able to tweak the magnets and get an extra .1 LPMI just purchased a 100 but haven't received it yet but I will test it and post the results when I do. I'm not knocking these pumps they're a good value for the money and are far superior to some of the others I have.

Then the tank filter, filters the water & flows downward to the buckets again. I just adjust the pH of the tank, which is hardly ever needed because of the plants absorbing the nitrates & minerals of the tank and then it flows to the buckets.These 2 pumps alone produce quite a bit of aeration for an approximate total of (4 gallons x 4 = 16 gallons). Each pump has 2 outlets that supply air for 2 Buckets, which I then split into 2 air stones for each bucket.

Instead of buying the cartridges that you have to throw out every month or two (which can add up to a lot of money in the long  - and short run) you can buy these reusable cartridges (only made to fit pengun power filters in the 200-350 size)that will last a long time providing you don't overstuff them. These cartridges are able to be filled with any media you would like. Carbon and other chemical media work well in these or you could fill them with biological material such as eheim substrat/substrat pro or matrix bio-media. The cartridge in itself could be enough mechanical filtration along with the chemical and or biological filtration media of your choice, but I chose to make them a little more efficient and place Poly-Fil Quilt Batting in front of the cartridges (or even inside the cartridges with the filter media) and they are just as good if not better (I would argue significantly better)than the replaceable filter cartridges. Just a warning though, these cartridges are labeled as a 12-pack. THIS IS NOT SO! I do not understand why they have it listed as a 12-pack as it really only comes as one refillable cartridge. So make sure you buy enough to fill your penguin power filter (the newer model penguin power filter 200 can fit two and the penguin power filter 350 can fit four).

My dog has all kinds of animal toys but when I saw the platypus, I had to have it for Daisy. The platypus looks like a duck met an otter and is so cute and so unusual in nature (it lays eggs and is a poisonous mammal?! How strange and wonderful!)BUT--this toy has eggs inside a stitched pouch and these are the squeakers. One is inside, the other two are in a net bag as spares. If you have squeaky toys for your pet, you know that after a lot of chewing, the squeaker goes silent, and if you wash the toy, that happens sooner. So, are the toy eggs suitable for my 55lb standard poodle? I don't think so--they are the size of duck eggs or goose eggs, and what if she should swallow them --they look like a choking hazard at a little under 3\" in diameter. I'm not even THINKING about giving her the eggs alone. One egg comes inside the toy, and it's stitched in. So I just basted the opening shut more securely with buttonhole thread.  When the squeaker goes, I can rip the stitches and put in the replacement. But I would not think of giving her access to the egg to play with.I will say, it's her favorite toy. She sleeps with it under her chin and even right now as I write this, she has discarded her previous favorite (a gingerbread man) to go upstairs to her bed to retrieve the Platypus. She carries it all around the house and she truly enjoys it.  I hope to find other toys like this for her--I know she prefers soft toys (poodles are kind of a bird retriever and this one seems to want to carry and chew on soft, bird-like toys.)So, if you get this, and your dog is bigger than a mini-dachshund, I'd sew the opening shut with strong, waxed thread or failing that, take out the egg entirely.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Dog LOVES this toy but I don' t love the size of the eggs", "unixReviewTime": 1386806400, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2013"}

I could see that one end of one of the bulbs was dark and the lens was melted right where that dark spot was.  I told her how long I had had the fixture and she told me it was most likely the bulb.  But, she also told me if it was the ballast, she would send me a replacement under warranty even though the warranty had expired.  I went to my local fish store and bought two new bulbs.  Voila!

So, I went to the overkill side and purchased this.  First, though, I want to address some of the other reviews.NO air pump, I repeat, NO AIR PUMP IS SILENT.  If a manufacturer tries to sell you a silent air pump, you need to step back and assess if their project development team has taken remedial physics.  Vibrations create sound, which means no silent vibrating air pump diaphragms.  According to classical physics, it is physically impossible for that to happen.  However, through sound damping and clever material choice, you can make it so that it's close to silent.  You'll never actually get there, but you can make it quiet enough to not be heard over the usual white noise of the home.This air pump is the quietest I've ever gotten my hands on.  I live in a building with a constant low level of background noise, and I have to concentrate to pick the pump's quiet hum out.  It's well constructed, the rubber feet do a lot in the way of damping sound, and if you have it in a bedroom, wrapping it with a towel makes it practically inaudible.  Otherwise, it's a very well built and well functioning pump for its price.

It also goes to a standard 10 gallon via a 2-way gang valve. So in essence it would be like connecting two 'bubble' devices up (think air stone plus bubbling treasure chest decoration as an example). The gang valve allows me to compensate for the 10 gallon not being as deep as the 20 gallon. For those interested, it is running a sponge filter in both tanks.With this set up, it is barely able to keep headway and only produces a minimal amount of bubbles. This is okay for me, since I run fully planted tanks and only need minimal water flow for temp and nutrient distribution. If I was doing two devices in the 20 gallon alone though, I'm not sure it would be powerful enough.How big of a pump do you need? It's all about depth and has nothing to do with volume ... which is how they are foolishly marketed.

But he really enjoys playing (and eating) the woven grass play ball. Shadow pushes the ball around with his nose. Sometimes he tries to fling the ball, but mostly he is pushing it or eating it.Peter's Woven Grass Play Ballhas a great smell which made Shadow's ear pop up when I opened the container. He was busy doing his bunny begging show - standing on his hind legs, lifting his paws out - so he could play/eat the ball as soon as possible.Somebody complained the ball is hollow (which it is). I look at it as a fun part - sneak a raisin or two into the hollowed out grass ball and it made Shadow do more binkies. It would be cool if there was one that was solid grass, I'm sure Shadow would go for that one.If you share your home with a bunny, this is a great gift for your little furry companion. You have a bad day at work, come home and give the furperson his/her gift and voila, you got entertainment for the night. The rabbit will binky (spontaneous jump in the air signifying happiness) and that will probably make you laugh. When I watch Shadow use this play ball, it makes me laugh and I forget about having a stinky day. Definitely cheaper than therapy and you can watch this for hours and still be able to drive your car home (presuming, of course, you are not consuming adult beverages). If you know somebody that has a rabbit, buy this and take it to the person's house so you can see what a binky  looks like in person.

It's just a patchwork sewn flimsy, cloth item with a slight crinkle noise.  The cool teething aspect is to wet the cloth exterior and wring out water, then freeze.  You can do that with anything. Puppy used it once for about 2 minutes and bit little cloth legs off and ate them. I was able to fish a small piece out his mouth when I realized the toy was \"edible.\"  This is poor advertisement; poor quality; and definitely not durable enough to be considered appropriate for puppy chewing.

However, when I filled the toy with kibble, Regal and our Malinois foster puppy both had to work for a couple of hours to empty it. Neither of them damaged the toy so it seems to be pretty safe for them. However, as with any toy, I will continue to monitor them frequently to be sure they haven't managed to chew off a piece that could be ingested. The puppy still has most of her baby teeth so I don't know how the toy will fare with her in a couple of months when her mouth will resemble that of a crocodile, but Regal (a Bulldog/Siberian Husky mix) didn't faze the material and he is a dedicated chewer. I'd feel better about this toy if it were made in the United States rather than China but I believe it will be OK with restricted use. Regal gets all of his meals from food puzzles and this one adds some variety to the mix.I'm adding to this review because we have been using it for several months now. I raised the rating to 5 stars because it has been so useful and the dogs have not damaged it at all. The puppy mentioned above got all of her adult teeth but I was still able to put peanut butter in the toy to pacify her in the crate when she fussed. It kept her happy for a couple of hours and she was never able to bite off a piece of the material. We now have our own adult Malinois, Sizzle, and we use it with him as well. I put kibble in it and let him get his dinner that way when he needs to be crated. I bought another one so that I can give Regal and Sizzle their own. The new foster puppy is doing well without a peanut butter pacifier for now, but I won't hesitate to use it with her if necessary. I still suggest watching any dog carefully with a toy.

It fits just about every type of treat, and you can choose different ways of stuffing it. Our dog isn't a big chewer, so we haven't had the problems that others have had with this toy.A few notes on our experience:- MOST IMPORTANT: The rawhide piece you see in the pictures came out right away, and became a chew-disk rather than part of the toy. We had to take it away so she wouldn't accidentally swallow it. (And there's another, sad review from someone whose dog choked on the rawhide and died - rawhide can be dangerous!!) I'd recommend supervising your dog the first time and seeing whether the rawhide comes out. Don't buy replacement rawhides until you're sure you need them.- You can vary the challenge level by how tightly you allow the tabs to hold a treat. You can fill the inner section with kibble, or you can wedge a biscuit or hard treat into the tabs, or you could freeze soft stuff in there. There's no need to buy special treats to fit this toy - it'll work with whatever you have.- Our dog likes to play with this ball even after the treats are out, throwing it to herself and chasing it around the house. We now give it to her (filled with treats) when we're going out as a way to reduce separation anxiety, and it almost always keeps her busy so she doesn't notice we're leaving.- It's silicone plastic, so it's softer and quieter than hard rubber toys on wood floors.- It cleans up very easily in the sink or dishwasher.- Unlike the Kong or the Squirrel Buddy, it has big holes on two sides (the holes in the picture are on both top and bottom). So I'm not sure how much of a mess it would make with peanut butter or frozen soft treats - we haven't tried, because hard treats work fine for us.- Doesn't fit a huge amount, so probably wouldn't work to feed your dog. Our dog takes about 15-20 minutes to get the treats out, then plays with it for a little while after that.Different dogs have different interests, but I completely recommend giving the Everlasting Treat Ball a try for your dog!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great toy for a gentle chewer", "unixReviewTime": 1324252800, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2011"}

My dogs play with it, but when I see them using their front teeth to carefully pick at the felt, I just say firmly \"don't pick!\" and they usually go back to normal chewing, which it stands up to fantastically.  On occasion, when they get to picking at the felt I take it away for a few minutes.Realistically speaking, any toy can be destroyed by a determined dog.  That magic indestructable toy you want does not exist!  If they are playing with it in your presence and you do interfere with certain behaviors, this will survive longer than the majority of toys.  We've had it for a month.  Most toys don't make it that long, tennis balls only last three big chomps.  These are dogs that shred the hardest nylabones.  A month of chewing is an impressive feat.Other stand outs in the Doberman tough toy market are orbee balls and tuff rings- just the rings not any other shapes.  Other KONG toys last primarily because they don't get played with unless we put a treat inside.

The first was an adult Rottweiler (about 90 lbs.) who didn't care for it all that much.  The second is a Rottie puppy (currently in the 50-60 lb. range) who adores it.  This review will be based on my experience with the second dog, as she has actually been getting quite a bit of mileage out of it.  (And to be fair, the first dog didn't like ANY tennis-ball-type toys or rubber toys.)As I said, my puppy loves this toy.  While she has numerous tennis-ball-type toys, this is one she keeps going back to.  She did start pulling the outer coating off of it during the first month I had her, but about 2/3 to 3/4 of the coating is still on there after three months.  I do have to monitor this closely so she doesn't swallow the coating, although it appears that at least small pieces \"pass through.\"Once my dog got big enough to get her mouth around the end, so she could make the thing squeak on her own, she fell in love with the toy a second time.  Unfortunately -- and this may be a result of the removed outer coating -- she did eventually puncture the toy all the way through.  It no longer squeaks because of this.  She still likes the toy, but the loss of sound has definitely equated to a loss of enthusiasm.Final assessment: Three stars because the puppy loves it and I've gotten three months of use out of it with her (which is longer than many other toys have lasted with this puppy), but a couple of stars off for durability.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "depends on the dog, may not stand up to active chewers", "unixReviewTime": 1366070400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2013"}

It's far from the only Kong product I own and I'll certainly buy more from them in the future. Just maybe not this particular model.My girlfriends little chihuahua/Rat Terrier mix does not chew habitually around the house but goes bonkers for the Kong filling I put down the middle and in the crevices of this dental stick. So when I filled this smaller version up for her after she had an awkward time trying to hold and chew the medium-sized one my Basenji/lab mix uses, she went crazy town on it.I kept looking down at her to make sure the vicious tooth-on-rubber squeaking sound I was hearing wasn't her ripping it to shreds and she seemed to be doing fine with it but when I looked back a few minutes later she had gotten a good grip on the thinner edges of the chew toy and finally pulled a few little corners of it off. It's worth noting that this didn't happen the first time I gave it to her, but rather after a few weeks of regular use.The Blue/Pink (and apparently there is a beige one but Ive never seen or experienced that ones quality myself)models are made from what feels like a softer rubber composition than the larger red Kong dental stick toys of the same style that they sell for bigger breeds.I wish they would re-release this toy in the normal denser red rubber model like the bigger one I have that just ended up being bit bigger than my Basenji/lab enjoyed. Shes 25lbs and more than twice my girlfriend's little chi-rat's size but still hasn't chewed through the 2nd mini one I got for her when she started stealing the first one from our chi-rat. So, based on that, I am guessing this toy is just not meant for truly dedicated chewers but will work great for the average pup without a turbo jaw.That was what cost it 1 star, the other 1 star is more just from the cleanliness factor. In retrospect I probably would have gotten a chew toy that did a little more to keep the goo inside the treat until the dog got it because when you put it down the grooves of this toy..then they bite it and drop it on the carpet to lick it... you get orange bacon cheese goo on your carpet.Both dogs do, however, keep very nice clean teeth with little brown buildup on their canines as a result of giving them these sticks a few times a week with some goo in them to encourage frantic chewing along with regular rawhide chews here and there in between.All in all:3/5 stars for being kind of messy and not standing up to the teeth of my girlfriends 12lb chihuahua/rat terrier mix but still being an effective design for aiding in doggy tooth cleaning and keeping them quiet and entertained for a descent window of time while working for every last bit of their treat. Also a total no-brainer to wash if you toss it in the sink in a cup of hot water for a while ahead of time to soak any dry goo bits they couldn't reach before they gave up.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good, but messy and less durable than my 12lb adult terrier mix needs.", "unixReviewTime": 1340668800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2012"}

During the warmer months, I was filling the bowl easily a half dozen times a day, Our largest dog, a 75lb lab could drink one whole bowl in a sitting when he came inside from playing in the backyard. Our family cat also seems to prefer drinking the water from the dogs bowl rather than his own dish. So no matter how often we were filling their bowl, it was just never enough. Inevitably at some point one of the dogs would come over to get our attention, so to bring us towards their bowls wanting them filled again.When I saw this Bergan dog waterer, I figured if it works, it would be exactly what we needed. I bought the 3 gallon model and have been so glad I did ever since. Now it only needs filled every other day (or so). For a family with smaller dogs, or less of them, this waterer will hold enough water for days probably. It's very simple to use. Simple pop the tank off the back, fill with water, screw the top back onto the tank and make sure the little hold is covered with its cap. Pop tank back into the tray and then reach under to the cap and remove the plug that's covering the water hole. The tank will fill with water and keep it filled with water as your pets drink.At first my dogs were a little confused by the \"glugging\" sounds made by the tank as the water would drain and air bubble would rise inside, but after about 2 days they never cared about it again. Now they will drink and drink even with the tank making the noise as is fills up with air. The dish tray is deep enough that it keeps water from spilling out, but not so deep that small dogs would have an issue drinking out of it. It's quite sill resistant, as I've found from my kids and pets bumping into it time and time again. It stays upright and doesn't leak. If anything ever happened to this one, I wouldn't hesitate at all to pick another one of these up.

I actually only wanted an automatic water dispenser as my dog needs his bowl refilled a million times a day, I was tired of the 2am wake up whining because his bowl became empty. I bought the setBergan Petite Gourmet Combo (Colors Vary)because they're about 17 a piece to buy them separately. So for a few dollars more I figured if the automatic feeder didn't work out for my dog I would just return to his slow feeder and use the automatic feeder for the cats.WATER DISPENSER:-Initially I found the water dispenser a little difficult, it didn't over flow or anything awful, I was just having a hard time getting the plug to stay closed before flipping the tank. however as I've continued to use it the plug now gives me no issue.-The wide fill opening: Allows for me to easily add some ice cubes to the tank. I'll have to find a suitable sized bowl to freeze larger chunks comes summer.-Filling once a day: Between my dog and cats using the water dispenser it's usually completely empty by morning so I'm refilling it once a day, which again is something I prefer as it avoids stagnant water.-We have a handful of cats and not one of them was frightened by the quiet gurgling, in fact most of them like to sit and swat at the bubbles that murmur up when you first tip it over.-I would like to mention after about a week of use I noticed a slight stagnant odor inside the water tank, so I would suggest giving it a good cleaning at least that often with some mild detergent or correctly diluted bleach. I have well water, someone with city treated or chlorinated water may not experience this but it's still probably a good idea to give it a clean through once in a while.---Update regarding stagnant smell--- The stagnant smell quickly became a regular problem, I was noticing it smelled every day when I changed the water. I started adding 1 tsp of Apple Cider Vinegar to the 1.5 gallons of water, it has completely remedied this problem, both the cats and dog do not seem to mind the addition either.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Perfect size", "unixReviewTime": 1357171200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2013"}

It was an old model that was hard to clean and was more of a tower design like so many of the other models that not only take up a lot of room, but could easily be knocked over.  (Not just by the pets as some of the other reviewers here have talked about, but by me).  I decided to pick up a newer model after getting another cat, and wanting to make sure that they had plenty of fresh water. In my opinion, This Bergan design is the perfect watering system, especially for small dogs and cats.  It holds about a gallon and half of water and its bottle design is set on a broader base rather than taking up room in height. Not only is it more of a space saving bottle shape, but it also makes for a wider mouth at the bottom that is very easy to get inside with a bottle brush or a smaller hand and keep clean.  In fact the whole bottle and basin unit on this model is very compact and easily fits inside a sink or on top of a counter to clean.  Although I realize that for those that own big dogs the capacity of this unit may be a little small, for small dogs and cats it is the perfect system for providing your pets with fresh water over an extended period of time.  Lastly, this Bergen Petite is just about the cheapest watering system I have ever come across, either in stores or here on Amazon.  At the time of this writing it ships for free when bundled, and is an excellent bargain.

Plus I'm pretty sure those Rx NSAIDs hold their own, similar warnings.  And I have to get blood tests once a year when I use the Rx meds.So I switched him to the Rx like my other dog and then ran out after a few months.  Switching back to these once again I have to say that I feel he is a bit better on this aspirin than the rx (generic tramadol)......he doesn't take as long to get up and doesn't fall as much on his arthritic legs.  If I thought he was happily buzzed and high and pain free like one would expect on the Rx I would happily go back but he does seem a bit better with these.UPDATE:My older dog went downhill quickly and suddenly started having real problems getting up and moving.  While these worked as well for a while and still did work fine for my other dog I found myself amping up his treatment.  I basically told the vet I didn't care if he was stoned as long as he was OUT OF PAIN and could rise on his hind legs easier again.  (It's not like we'll find him selling his body on the corner to get more and more drugs now....)  So he's back on Novox for inflammation AND now also Tramadol max amount for pain and this has given him back his back legs.  So while I believe in these aspirins for some pain be aware that there ARE better and higher levels of pain relief available and these should be your next line of defense when even the aspirin doesn't work.

Buddy will walk up to his bowl of home cooked dog food made of fat free chicken breast/brown rice and some veggies he just adores.

But, before making a purchase, I evaluated what type of barking they were doing to determine if it was anxious/fearful barking or rather just barking to alert one another (or us) of people/dogs walking by. Through watching their facial expression & body language, I determined that they are just barking to bark, to alert one another (or us), or barking out of excitement - there is no anxiety/fear association. As such, I wanted a device that would get their attention away from the stimuli so they can pause & think, without causing them physical discomfort. I have been diligent to provide positive feedback/training & verbal cues along with the use of this device. Here is how I use it:When they start barking at a passerby, I press the button once or twice & immediately say \"No bark.\"  When they stop barking, I praise them & give a treat. This method has reduced the barking to the point where sometimes I can say, \"No bark\" just before or as they see passerby's without having to use the device, & they will not bark. They know that letting out a bark from seeing passerby's will elicit use of the device. However, with that said, I do not use the device to deter barking all together - only when barking occurs from passerby's. Dogs are dogs, & dogs should bark as a natural form of communication, so I am teaching them when it is & is not appropriate to bark. To this point, they are understanding the distinction just fine! They still bark when we are playing, when they get excited, & they still make barking sounds in the morning & when we come home as their way of saying, \"hello\" to us.I also carry this with me when we go on walks to deter them from barking at other dogs (which they don't usually do anyway) & to deter other dogs from darting out as us (ex. stray dogs, dogs not kept in a fence or on a leash, etc.). It causes the loose dogs to stop so we can get past them. It is a great safety tool to have with you when you go for walks!Because each of my two girls are unique, one is more sensitive to the device than the other now. Initially, they both experienced the same reaction to the device, but now one of them doesn't seem as bothered by it, while the other is still very bothered by it. So, do not be surprised if the sensitivity to the sound that the device elicits eventually wears off & they are no longer bothered by it. Fortunately, I haven't needed to use the device too often because they picked up on the training pretty quick because I made it a positive situation, & helped them make distinctions between when it is & is not appropriate to bark.For this device to be effective: a) first evaluate the root cause of the barking b) combine it with immediate positive reinforcement c) combine it with verbal reinforcement d) only use it when warranted. Using a device to remedy barking that stems from fear/anxiety is not the correct way to deter barking.

It is well padded and comfortable for my golden retriever. Very few dogs are restrained in cars, and that is a shame. The Solv-It harness comes with a secure strap that is attached to the lap or shoulder part of a buckled seat belt. It works well but after nearly three years of strain on my seat belt it no longer retracts as snugly as it used to. But I discovered a different type of secure strap this one: the PetBuckle Pet travel Safety Tether. It secures into the LATCH/ISOFIT latches in every car since 2003 designed to secure child safety seats. So by using the PetBuckle I can attach the dog harness to the car without putting constant strain on my rear seat belt because it is secured to the LATCH attachment.There is one detail I need to clarify. This large strap is supposed to be 30&#34; long.  It isn't, at least on its own. The main strap is 25&#34; long. The adapter strap to use it with a seat belt in a car that doesn't have the LATCH connectors. This adapter is about 5&#34; long, so the two pieces together equal about 30&#34;. But because I'm securing a large dog with a long spine, the main strap itself was not long enough to give her enough freedom of movement. And because the main reason I bought this strap was to relieve stress on the same outboard seatbelt in the rear of my car I decided to combine the main strap of this product with the 6&#34; or so (adjusted to its shortest length) strap that came along with her Solv-It Car Safety Harness.  This product is snapped into the LATCH connector, and it is clicked into the carabiner of the safety harness strap and that is then connected to the safety harness the dog is wearing. This all works together for me.  But it is important to keep in mind that the length isn't 30&#34;. It may or may not be a concern to you.My dog can sit, lie down, and put her head out of the window and I know she is safe and secure. And my car's leather upholstery is protected by a cover from wet feet, hair, and mud.

So, back to Amazon for a shorter seat belt attachment.  Unfortunately, no manufacturer makes this thing any shorter.  So, I looked at the various existing designs that might shorten the over all length via attachment options.  The PetBuckle Kwik-Connect Tether did it!  Using this reduced the length by approximately 3 inches...which was like a magic number to discourage him from standing on the center console.  It was a lot easier to get him to back off the console and sit down now...plus using the pinch collar...he is more obedient while wearing the pinch collar.  Whenever he chooses to climb back up on the console, I lift up on the pinch collar, and he remembers the last command and sits down again.  As for the Kwik-Connect feature, I love it!  I don't have to mess with digging for the seatbelt buckle under the pet hammock cover...just simply disconnect to take him out of the truck, and quickly reconnect once back in the truck.

I put about 1 1/2 cups of pine pellets in the Ugodog tray which is lined with plastic--I buy the Glad OdorShield Tall 13 gal. trash bags and cut them in half because cat box liners didn't fit.  Then the grate goes on top. I change the pellets about once a week or every 5 days and the pine completely covers the urine odor.  It's easy to lift out the liner and fold up and dispose of the used pellets and solids are flushed.  I tried using paper instead of the pine pellets, but they smelled and were not as absorbent.

We started out with the doggie litter pellets which we mutually agreed were awful so we switched to traditional clumping cat litter. My dog neurotically spins about 50 circles in her litter box before she'll actually do her business, which kicks up a lot of dust. Not only was the dust getting into her lungs and making her cough, it was settling on everything in my house. This was a problem. We had other smaller issues with traditional litter as well, like the occasions when she'd step in the middle of her business and get wet disgusting litter smashed up in her paws (and all over my floors) and just the mess of it in general (picture a tiny fluffy dog spinning rapid circles in a small area, spraying little pieces of clay in all directions). We've been through several brands of clumping clay litter and all have yielded similar results. Finally enough was enough, and with all these gripes about traditional litter I began my search for something better.When I first heard about this product I was a bit leery as the pellets resemble the dog litter we tried way back when but the idea of trying an all natural product combined with the reasonable price B&M; was enough to persuade me to buy a bag.I emptied out her litter box completely and replaced the litter with the pellets. The first time I introduced her to her new box of pellets she seemed hesitant but with a bit of coaxing she spun a few circles and did her business. Since then she's gone in her box without issue, and despite the circle spinning she's not kicking up dust and making herself cough every time she's in there, nor is she making a mess all over my floors.Scooping this stuff takes a bit of getting used to. When the pellets get wet they break down into what looks like fluffy sawdust (see customer images).  I scoop a couple times per day to ensure no sawdust gets tracked through my house. Even when wet the \"sawdust\" is never sticky and is easily removed from the box. I just scoop a small amount at a time and shake it over the trash can to sift out the sawdust, then return the remaining pellets in the scoop to the box.My only gripe about this product would be the smell. The pine smell was rather strong at first but it does dissipate (although it never disappears completely). Personally I prefer the smell of pine over the smell of perfumed clay litter though so all things considered it's not too bothersome.Overall I'm really pleased with this product.

I have tried them all.  I've tried the pearls, the corn litter, the paper litter, and of course the traditional clay litter.  The thing I love the most about this litter is how little it can be tracked.  The pearls can be tracked, and it hurts like a @#$%#$ when you accidently step on it.  The corn litter and the paper litter doesn't mask the smell of urine.  And the clay litter leaves dusty floors no matter how many times you clean.  The pine litter is by far the least tracked litter.  Another thing I like about this litter is the way it can cover up urine smell.  It smells like wood, or the \"new furniture smell\", even after the cats do their thing.  The litter turns to powder after it comes in contact with urine.  But since it absorbs it so well, you just see saw-dust.  All you have to do is scoop up the solid waste, and when the puebbles turn mostly to powder, you just change out the litter.  The powder can be tracked a little bit, but again, must less than any other litter.Something I recently learned is that if you collect the pine points at the back of the package, you can redeem it for scoopers and litter boxes and other kitty stuff.

My 7-month-old kitten uses it, my two-year-old Siamese and my 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair. We have two of the special sifting litter boxes made by the third-party company which makes them for Feline Pine. That is the only way to use Feline Pine, in my opinion, because it is so easy to use that way. Love this litter!EDITED TO ADD 2/10/2010: This is my new favorite cat litter. It does not track. It smells of fresh, natural, wood scent - no added scents, nothing artificial. It has a special litter box made by a third party for Feline Pine that you can buy to sift and separate the fresh granules from the used sawdust. Call the company, Feline Pine, and ask them for details on how to buy their litter box and they will tell you how to order one. I was concerned because my vet said cats have trouble digging in it. In reality, they don't dig at all to urinate, or they dig very little and they defecate on top of it, which is easily removed.Get the sifting litter box, made by a company specifically for this litter, and tilt the box back and forth, sifting the litter once or twice a day to remove any \"sawdust\" from the top level--this will shift the sawdust to the bottom level of the two-level box. Use the box as directed for best results.I have never been so happy with a litter system in my life. It has made life very easy. No more dusty litter everywhere. No more small clay granules tracking all over the house. (Note: the litterbox is denoted as \"self cleaning\" but it really is not; however, it is so easy! All you do is tilt it side to side and sift.)I have found my litter. I am 100% happy with this litter, COMBINED with their litter box.How to switch your cats to this litter: Put one inch of this litter on top of your current litter. Let your cats dig into it and mix it up as they use both litters in the same box. Gradually increase the quantity of this litter used and lessen the quantity of your old brand. I switched an 18-year-old cat to this litter!A NOTE ABOUT PINE OIL:  There is no toxic pine oil in Feline Pine cat litter. Many people think of pine oil in products like Pine Sol, which contains phenol, which *is* highly toxic to cats. I contacted the company prior to using this product. I received this assurance:\"The production of our Feline Pine products incorporates both kiln-drying at 380 degrees (bakes out oils, phenols, and hydrocarbons) and pressurization (10,000 foot-pounds squeezes out further compounds) before the product reaches its packaging.\"\"Our litters are completely natural and contain zero chemicals or artificial fragrances.\"My vet, who has a cats-only vet clinic, and who has treated my 18-year-old cat since he was a kitten, highly recommends this litter.~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEW:I initially tried this out with a litter of four rescued three-week-old kittens and their mother. It doesn't track and is big enough that the kittens don't try to eat it.  If the kittens sample it, it won't hurt their digestive tracts like clay clumping litter could. Downside: It is hard for kittens to dig in as the granules are so big.After the granules are broken down, they are easier for your cat to dig, as they turn into sawdust.Pros:* Low to zero tracking* Produces zero dust* No odor - excellent odor control* Safe for kittens and cats of all ages* Flushable* Turns into sawdust after it is urinated on; and then it is easy for cats to dig in* NOTE: Feline Pine now makes a clumping form of this litter; it is a separate product* Lasts a really long time before you need to change itCons:* Large granules make digging harder for cats (the vet said this but I didn't find it to be a problem)* Doesn't cover poop well when it is in granule form. (However, I scoop poop up quickly)(However, if you leave your Feline Pine in the box to turn to sawdust, it *will* cover poop.)* Is not a clumping litter (but Feline Pine now makes a clumping version of this litter!) This is the granules version; see the clumping version if you prefer that kind.NOTE: This Feline Pine \"granules\" is not a clumping litter.  (But they now make a clumping litter version of this product if you want to try it.)  For the granules version, once those large granules of wood are urinated on, it turns into dry sawdust.  It doesn't clump and is hard to scoop because the dry sawdust mixes with the granules.  It will stay dry for quite awhile -- a few days or a week or two -- depending on how many cats you have.  The best way to clean this litter is to remove all of it and put in new litter.The great thing about the granules is, zero tracking. And it really covers the urine smell.  If you want to scoop, try Feline Pine's clumping litter. I prefer this to Feline Pine's clumping litter, as the clumping litter doesn't clump very well and it still tracks.To get your cats accustomed to this litter, read and follow the instructions on the bag.  It is very important to put a layer of at least one inch of your old litter on top of this new litter, or your cat will probably not accept this litter. Please be patient with your cat during the transition.The litter granules are made of Southern Pine. Tree farmers periodically have to thin some of the smaller trees to let in sunlight, which makes the forest healthier.  Those smaller pine trees are used in these types of renewable products. This is an eco-friendly choice in cat litter.My vet said cats find it hard to dig in.  I agree, but once the granules are broken down by urination, cats find it easier to dig.  Swheat Scoop ... I plan to give that one a try next time. UPDATE: Actually, I did, but I think I prefer Feline Pine, plus now Feline Pine has come out with a scoopable version. I plan on mixing the two: the Feline Pine granules with the Feline Pine scoopable, as I'd like to scoop but also like the no-tracking granules.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pro: No Tracking granules!

Karazim", "helpful": [4, 5], "reviewText": "In the search for a more natural and less waste-producing cat litter, I stumbled upon Feline Pine.  Since I could not find an official Feline Pine cat box to use with it, I decided to try the Tidy Cats Breeze litter box.  My cat seemed to like Feline Pine just fine, and the Breeze box seemed fine, too.  At first.As for the litter itself, the true subject of this review, I really like it.  I especially like that you can actually flush the cat poop down your toilet, since the pellets dissolve into sawdust when they are wet.  Although the pellets did seem to stick to the poop, it was still really easy to scoop out of the box and dispose of.  I didn't notice much tracking beyond a very close perimeter of the box, probably due more to her attempting to bury her waste than to the pellets sticking to her paws.  No tracking upstairs as with the old clumping clay litter, no \"litter box feet\" smell on the actual cat, and no more licking clay litter dust when she is grooming.  The odor of the box is not horrible, but it certainly doesn't mask the poop odor like clumping litter.  I didn't buy it for that purpose, and my box is in the basement, so no big deal.  The smell wasn't intolerable, just kind of funky.  Wet sawdust meets cat urine meets poop.  And, this litter is pretty reasonable and lasts quite a long time, in my opinion longer than a tub of clumping litter because you don't use as much in the box.  Ultimately, the litter is a great product if you have a proper box to use it with.Now, for the box.  I read many reviews where people mentioned using the Breeze box with Feline Pine.  And it does work.  Kind of.  The wet sawdust falls into the tray below and the tray can be emptied into the trash.  The solid waste stays on top.  Every time I scooped the poop I'd sift the box, bringing the dust down to the tray.  Then I would dump the tray and I was done.  Very simple.  The problem is that every once in awhile you really do need to clean the box.  I don't mean scoop, I mean clean, with actual soap and water.  The tray gets rather nasty with all that urine-soaked sawdust falling down there (sometimes I'd even have standing puddles of urine waiting when I pulled out the tray) and would benefit from a soap and water cleansing about once a month.  So begins the nightmare.  The box is hard to clean with this litter in it!  The pellets get stuck in the sifting grid, and I don't have a utility sink in my laundry room, so I hauled the box upstairs to the tub to try to \"rinse\" them out.  The pellets dissolve in water, right?  No, they don't dissolve!  They turn into sawdust!  Big mistake.  Don't be foolish like I was and try to put Feline Pine sawdust down your tub drain.  Duh!  It clogs the drain!  I ended up with a bunch of sawdust in my tub, which I then had to plunge out of the drain and scoop out with my hands.  Disgusting.  I should really have tried picking them out first and then washing the box.  Live and learn.  Either way, it is a huge pain to soap-and-water cleanse the box.I am deducting a star because Feline Pine makes a box specifically for this litter, but it's not available!  I guess you could use a regular box, but that seems an even worse option.  You'd have a ton of soggy sawdust sitting on the bottom, and the cat would end up digging in that.

It doesn't smell like a litter box typically does (like clay, urine and feces). Feces do smell right after your cat uses the box, but this goes away. The idea that a cat litter is going to eliminate feces odor right when the cat goes doesn't make sense to me...it would have to be loaded with chemicals and perfumes, which I don't want. The odor goes away within a few minutes, and I just scoop out feces at the end of the day.2. It is very inexpensive. You only fill the box a small amount, unlike clay litters. I use it along with the Feline Pine Self cleaning litter box, and this is the best value. I only have to buy a new bag of litter once or twice a YEAR.3. It does not track nearly as bad as clay or other fine grained litters4. Biodegradable materialsWhat would you rather have, a litter box with 3 or 4 inches of clay litter that starts smelling after only a couple of days and is disgusting and must be trashed by the end of the week, or an inch of Feline Pine, that does not smell and lasts for 2 weeks before needing to be changed? I almost want to laugh when I go to people's houses and I see their disgusting clay litter boxes, or see people buying clay litter at the store. Don't they know there's a way that is not only better for the environment, but doesn't smell and is a better value?I would also like to note that my cat is one of those picky sensitive cats that will not use litters with a lot of perfume or with a texture she doesn't like. I purchased the generic pine pellets at the pet store once and she flat out refused to use them, but she ok with the Feline Pine pellets.To those who are saying FP is a \"poor value\" because you can buy horse pellets at the store and they are the same, first of all I have my doubts that they are exactly the same and break down the same. I also don't understand why it is even an issue, considering that FP is cheaper than clay cat litters and works better. Personally I like shopping for cat litter and knowing that I am supporting a good environmentally friendly company, rather than a company that makes clay litter loaded with perfumes and chemicals.Note about the price: I don't recommend buying it here on Amazon.

Healthy Weight has 415 calories per cup and 3.290 calories/gram.  Compared to the Longevity line for adult dogs, Healthy Weight has more calories per cup but a fewer calories per gram, meaning that Healthy Weight has more grams per cup than Longevity. Looking at the order of ingredients (which is by pre-production ingredient weight), I am concerned that too much of Healthy Weight's protein may come from whole grains, which do not contain all of the amino acids that a dog must get from his or her food (dogs cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from plants and grains the way humans can.) De-boned chicken is the first ingredient, but, because it contains 75% water before processing, it is not the heaviest final ingredient.  Chicken meal is a high quality protein, but it is listed as the fifth ingredient.Also: At the bottom of this review I name a brand of food that ultimately helped me meet my dog's goals.Overview of Weight Control: While I did not do all I could to make Weight Control work for my dog, it ultimately did not help my dog reach his ideal weight. Blue Weight Control is nutrient rich, very low in fat, and uses high-quality protein sources. Unfortunately, Blue Weight Control has 444 calories per cup, which  is pretty calorie-dense.  I believe it was over 4 calories per gram, which, in human food, is the caloric density of cheddar cheese.  My dog may have been able to eat a satisfying quantity of this food if he only needed to maintain a healthy weight, but he needed to lose weight, and the portions I had to feed him were too small. Fortunately, Blue Buffalo makes an excellent food calledBlue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag, and the adult food has a more reasonable 354 calories per cup, allowing my dog to eat a more satisfying quantity of food per day.Details: My dog weighed 50 lbs. and needed to get to the maximum ideal weight for his breed --44 lbs.-- as determined by my vet and the American Kennel Club.  According to several dog nutritionists, the calories a dog should consume per day to lose weight is computed as follows:  1)Convert his goal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2.  For my dog 44 lbs over 2.2= 20.  2  Multiply her weight in KG by 30.  For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog's case, that meant 670 calories per day.  This number represents the dog's caloric needs while on a weight loss diet, assuming the dog has no special needs, such as pregnant or whelping, being a puppy, being a toy breed, working, or living outdoors in cold weather. The formula only is valid if the dog weighs between 5 and 99 pounds. Check with your vet to make sure the daily calories you compute are in the right neighborhood.The reason Blue Weight Control was not the best Blue Buffalo food for my dog was because it is is relatively calorie dense-- 444 calories per cup. To feed him 670 total calories per day, I could only feed him 1.5 cups per day, meaning that each of his two meals could only be 3/4 cups, and that was without even a tiny buffer for a single green bean as a treat. (Later I explain why I had to add-in other foods.  I ended up only feeding him 2/3 of a cup for each meal, and that really worried me about the adequacy of his nutrition. This quantity of food is well below the feeding guidelines on the bag. My dog was miserable and begged constantly. He would even lick his empty bowl between meals.  I tried feeding him a 1/3 cup (10 calories) of plain no-added-salt canned green beans as a snack, just to help fill his stomach, but he was not content and eventually turned his nose up at the green bean snacks.  I should have added warm water to his dog food and stirred in the green beans, but I wasn't smart enough to do so at the time. My dog kept acting hungry and begging for more dog food.  He would actually walk over to the bag of dog food, put his paw on it, and look at me while whining softly! Other members of my household would sneak table food to him because he begged so persistently, and the \"diet\" was a abysmal failure.  My poor dog ended up actually gaining 4 more pounds from all the human cheating!I was glad I found Blue Longevity adult food.  It has 354 calories per cup as opposed to 444. It has 3.384 calories/gram.  I gave my dog 1.8 cups per day (in 2 meals) for 640 calories. A saleswomen at Petsmart explained that I could help increase my dog's feeling of fullness even more by adding warm water to to his food, enough to just cover the kibble, and letting it sit on the counter a minute so that the kibble would swell up. I should then stir in 10 calories (a little less than 1/4 cup) of no-added-salt green beans to make it an even more filling meal. I did all of these changes together, so I can't separate the effects. My dog stopped the whining and began to lose the weight.I budgeted him only 10 calories per day for treats. The problem was, I had to find something to give as a treat at least 3 times per day.  See, my dog lived in a no-kill shelter for 18 month, so I had to use treats to re-housebreak him. Now he refuses to do #2 unless he is guaranteed a treat (if he doesn't get one immediately after he goes, he lies down on the ground and makes us carry him home--even if we are two blocks from the house and it is dark and pooring down rain. Welcome to my world of loving an Australian Cattle Dog.) I was surprised to learn that small sized Milk Bones have 20 calories each and contributed to him getting overweight to begin with. Even breaking one in half wasn't enough to make his treat calories reasonable. I found a bite-sized treat that is only 1-2 calories calledPremier Liver Biscoti Dog Treats, Original Recipe, Original Bite Size, 8oz. Bag).  They were fine as a substitute for Milk Bones. I recently found a 2-calorie  treat that my dog is crazy about called Zuke's Mini Naturals Salmon Dog Treats (not to be confused with the 10-calorie eachZuke's Mini Bakes Chicken N Cherryz, 16 oz. My dog would probably walk through fire for the Salmon flavored ones, but he also likes the peanut butter flavored ones.Update: I eventually found a web site called DogFoodAdvisor.com.  Through it, I found another food calledPremium Edge Healthy Weight I Weight Reduction Formula Adult Dry Dog Food, 35-Poundthat has the same calories per cup as Longevity but that has twice as much protein (also from high quality sources!) It is also grain-free (dogs don't need grains in their diet at all) and a little less expensive per pound.  It helped my dog build muscle and lose weight.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Low fat, but not Blue's lowest calorie formula", "unixReviewTime": 1305504000, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2011"}

I really appreciate that the scratch insert can be flipped over, so you get get double the usage out of it. Its also nice to have the outside box, because that way when you sprinkle catnip into the box, it does not end up on the floor. All the little torn-off cardboard pieces will stay in the box, too.It is also a stylin' box. The yellow tassles are cute (and the cats like them) and the black and white stripes on the side look good.This is a dramatic improvement over the cat scratch insert it replaced.

(How did she know we'd take care of them?)  We did TNR on the babies and mom, then turned them loose.  We bought a small doghouse at the Farmers Co-op, closed off the big door, and made two small doors -- one at either end.  (The cats wouldn't go in unless there were two options for escape, I guess.)  We lined the walls with heat-reflecting mylar.  We put it on the screen porch and the kittens would go in and cuddle as the days got colder.  Then, as temps got lower, we started to worry that they might not survive, and we wondered if they'd be OK the next morning, so we tossed and turned every night.  Then we saw this pad on Amazon and ordered it in Sept. 2011.  DH cut a small hole in one of the floor slats of the doghouse for the cord, and we plugged it in.  The babies loved it.  By this time, their mom had cut them loose and she only came by to eat and then leave.  Knowing the babies were warm, we were able to sleep through the night, pretty confident they'd be OK as far as weather was concerned.In Nov. 2011, with the threat of coyotes and evil raccoons in the area, we brought the babies indoors to join our existing four (too many cats!)  We put the doghouse and kitty pad in the garage for storage.  This summer, Mom Darth started to stick around the screen porch and visit with her kids through the French door window.  (Abandon three babies, and then return to get all friendly a year later -- sounds like a \"Lifetime\" movie!)  We set up the doghouse with the kitty pad a couple weeks ago, and Darth is loving her warm place.  She's truly feral with no chance of taming, so we're happy she has a place where she knows she can be warm and safe.  We don't worry and there's a lot to be said for peace of mind.We also bought one of the thermostat cubes (on at 35 degrees) to use in conjunction with the pad, but the cube doesn't work.  We just plug in the pad when it gets down to about 40 degrees, and generally don't use it 24/7 -- just when it's sure to be cold.  And we've looked at outlets that can be activated via remote control; that might be a better option than do the plug and un-plug on cold days/nights.Will be ordering another pad for backup in case this stops working.

Lastly, while I couldn't take him to the vet (he is a true feral cat), I took pictures a very swollen paw on my Ipad and showed them to the vet who prescribed antibiotics to minimize the possibility of infection.Then winter came and I purchased the kitty camper (through Amazon) which is a small dome like tent for cats with a built-in heating pad to get him through the winter.Then the neighbor cat caught on about the food and the heated kitty camper so I purchased this item as a second heating pad and placed it in a old dog house I had for my Shih Tzu.  Now the 2 cats don't have to argue over who gets the heating pad and this pad was more economical the buying another kitty camper.

Just maneuver the tip of the syringe so it is just behind the hump of your pet's tongue and press the plunger.  It will gently push the pill into your pet's mouth, and they will swallow it.

This was the only stroller with large wheels that seemed an appropriate size for my cat that I could find.  The city streets and sidewalks around here are such that a small wheeled stroller could easily have issues.The stroller was easy to put together.  It  fine on uneven city sidewalks & streets, up and down curbs, on uneven brick sidewalks - I'm sure it could conquer the cobblestone ones as well  -  even without enough air in the tires (I did need  to get someone to help me put the air in - probably because of my bike pump not the stroller). The cat adjusted quickly and was chillin' inside the stroller at the vet despite  having no time to adjust to the carrier before the vet appointment. (the catnip spray might have helped...)  There was room for his food bowl and he could turn around and stretch out a little but it was not too big either. He's about 13 pounds.  The front wheel doesn't turn and the stroller is big enough that maneuvering in small spaces is a bit tricky. Still, overall it wasn't too hard to maneuver around obstacles. It wasn't difficult to put on the hood/sun shade but I did have difficulty removing it. It was difficult to press hard enough on the release points to get it to release.My cat seemed to like it as well once he adjusted (I really like the front shade which you can put up or down as needed)  - so I'm excited that I might be able to go on walks with him to give him a bit more stimulation than he can otherwise get as an indoor cat in a high rise building.Edit:  While this use is perhaps a bit beyond what the stroller was designed for,  I do wish it was easier to remove the compartment from the stroller  and that there was some internal support (and a handle) so it could be used independently. I want to take my cat to someone who is only accessible by bus/train + a walk. Since open strollers aren't allowed on public transportation where I live - it be nice to be able to run to the train/bus, remove the carrier/fold the stroller get on the bus, get off the bus and then open stroller, replace carrier and jog to appointment. I just feel a little sad having to use the cat's crate for this trip when he enjoys being in this stroller so much more. :) And the really nice places to walk a cat are at least a bus ride away...

But with that said, it is not without its flaws. First I must say that I saw a lot of reviews saying that this container couldn't fit a 40lb bag of dog food.  That is false.  Because it can.  I put a 15lb bag of Wellness puppy mixed with a 15lb bag of BlueBuffalo puppy small kibble in the container, and I could have fit more than 10 lbs more.  I think it all has to do with the size and density of the kibble that determines how much space it takes up in the container. If you got a 40lb bag of large light weight kibble, then you may find it hard to fit the entire bag, but if you got small breed or puppy size kibble and its a rich and heavy mix, then you will find it easy to fit more than 40lbs.But on to the flaw... the plastic, although sturdy isn't the strongest.  It does get a air tight seal, but when I got my container, it was cracked. it was stacked on during shipping and the container was not tough enough to have a heavy load on top.  Amazon replaced it immediately and paid return shipping, but still I'm disappointed with the quality of the plastic.  But for 25 bucks, could you really expect it to be any better? Probably not.

It easily holds the 35lb small bite kibble dog food and seems to seal it in to keep out bugs etc.  It has a lid that secures onto the container body and forms a seal by way of a rubber insert.It came with no directions and the rubber insert was not pre-fitted, so I am not a 100% sure I fit the rubber insert properly: it doesn't snap into any groove on the lid or clip onto the rim of the main body of the container - it just kind of lies in place.  But it seems to work.  The lid also has a round hatchtype insert which you spin to open.  You can spin it quite tight to close which might make it a bit tough to open if you have arthritis in your hands.  If I tighten it too tight I feel it in my tennis elbow when I unscrew it.  You may remove the lid entirely if you feel you need a bit of extra room to access the main container, but it is not as easy or convenient to pull the whole lid off as it is to unscrew the hatch. If you have a physical ailment that would stop you from grasping and spinning the hatch, I would not pick this container - I would pick one with a flip/clip lock.I do like it a lot and it is exactly what I was looking for.  I only gave it four stars as it did crack within the first minutes of owning it.  I was washing it in the kitchen sink and as it is large, awkward and wet the container slipped out of my hand and hit the granite counter top (maybe a fall of a foot). That was enough to put a crack in the corner of the container (not the lid.) The crack is not one you can move, rather a small crack like you might see in a car windshield - it still functions but is probably weakened. I felt that it should have survived that small impact.  At that point, as the kids had already turned the box into a car, I could not return the item and decided it would be fine.  I have had it for a few months now and still love it, and if it ever did need replacing I would replace it with the same.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "dog food storage does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1313107200, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2011"}

Now a few pointers!!I used Poise Ultra Absorbent people pads inside and they were fantastic VS the Simple Solutions pads which sadly were terrible and a total waste of money. Simple Solution pads are just over priced expensive Kotex pads that could not handle the amount of urine that can occur unlike the Poise pads, remember this is what Poise pads are used for. You should get the ones that fit how much you dog drips so it may take some experimenting my dog was large so mine were the most absorbent I could get. Great thing is you can get them in-store and on sale almost anywhere!I bought baby wipes to wipe him down and keep him clean, remember it is the same concept as a baby wearing a diaper and sitting in it, I didn't want to risk any infection. No alcohol!Make sure you measure your dog, to tight can cause a lot of chafing!! Mine was the right size but I ended up sewing micro-fiber cloth on the elastic part where the material scrunched up as this was causing chafing behind his manly area. He was not use to anything rubbing his skin in that area and the material is pretty stiff. I had to leave it off till it healed and sadly I never had the chance to see if the microfiber would have relieved the problem. Make sure you check your dog to make sure this is not occurring due to some dogs have a higher tolerance to pain. It would be great if they could use a softer material in the elastic area. I wish they were a tad cheaper in price, I did purchase one at Petsmart and the other on Ebay for a fraction of the cost, if you don't mind used(they are washed!!) it's a deal!  I would recommend but def do some shopping as they are not cheap!", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Male Wrap is Great-Liner Pad is Not", "unixReviewTime": 1325462400, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2012"}

I had completely tightened everywhere I could and it hung off of her.  My husband was supposed to return it but never did so I ordered the \"small\" figuring we'd have better results.The size discrepancy between the two sizes was ridiculous!  The small was so tiny even fully extended for it's full size that it wouldn't even go half way around her chest area.  We still had the medium to compare it too.  As it had been awhile since we bought the medium and she had grown a bit more we tried it on our dog again and although still big it wasn't as loose as it had been but it still did not fit tightly as the instructions told you to adjust it.  It was quite loose around both her back and around the front and the only part that we could adjust it enough so it was fitted right was around her belly area.  I ended up gathering up some of it across her back and sewing a few stitches in it to get it to be as snug as the directions indicated.Although the front was still a bit loose we decided to give it a try and took her out for her walk. Seemed to make the walks much better as she was still pulling but not as much as she had been and the walks were much easier with her being much easier to control.  So that was a few days ago. Went to put the harness on her today and noticed that the part of the harness where you attach the leash the material there had split halfway through and if I hadn't noticed it I'm sure it would have ripped the rest of the way and my puppy would have been loose. Glad I noticed because we not only live on a busy street we live in a heavily wooded area with a marsh in the back and lots of coyotes and we never want her to be off her leash for fear she could get hit by a car or disappear into the woods.So definitely a one star for me, product does seem to work but the discrepancy from the small to medium makes it impossible to find a size that will fit properly and the fact that it was in danger of breaking all the way through after just a few outings is really bad.

I do believe something about a regular collar just makes some dogs want to pull more. This harness eliminates that in a gentle way. Make sure you get a regular leash for the harness (not extendable) with a light clip because a heavy one will drag down the all important front strap which needs to be tight across the chest. Otherwise when it hangs it jerks with each dog step. The harness has wide, sturdy straps. My dogs a chewer but the Easy Walker is snug and out of reach and he hasn't touched it after several weeks (he destroyed the slim Sporn harness day two and another dog chewed it clear through in a second while playing, but after it hauled on the Easy Walker it showed no damage).Cons: Sizing is hard to go by. My pyrenees/collie mix has a 30\" girth so I got the large harness and the chest strap is too loose no matter how I finagle all the straps. I ordered the medium and its too small. Then I come to find out on the box there's a medium/large size. I wish I'd known that. The strap adjustments tend to slip, but once I found a happy adjustment I eventually duct taped the buckles to deter slippage. Because you hook the leash up front at the chest, when the dog switches sides of the road/path, you have to swing the leash around the front of the head to clear it from being wrapped round the neck. Not a huge bother, but something to think about dealing with if you prefer a leash not semi wrapped around the neck and not making full use of the no pull effect.Overall I like the Easy Walker no pull harness. Its inexpensive, comfortable like a regular collar for the dog (though I take it off at night) and well worth the price for dissuading annoying pulling. Sometimes I go back to just a collar and the dog goes right back to pulling  so I'm reminded the harness works.

My youngest dog is a puller. She can't wait to get on with the walk and so would pull me like she was a dog pulling a sled, nearly pulling my arm out of its socket. Not to mention the other hazards that could result from this type of behavior. More than once I was literally pulled to the ground and I knew something had to be done. Walking one dog at a time was not an option because the dog left behind would be in quite a state when I returned and I have had to replace the shades on the window because of the dog trying to get out while I was gone with the other dog. When I received this harness I thought, hopefully this one will work. I have tried other harnesses that only seemed to increase the pulling. When we got outside on our first walk with the Easy Walk Harness I realized that a miracle had taken place. No pulling, both of my arms can hang comfortably by my side now and I can walk both dogs at the same time and usually without incident. Of course that is not counting when the dogs see a cat but even then it is much easier to bring them under control. I recommend that you make sure to get the right fit but other than that this is the best product I have found to prevent pulling.

In terms of walking, it prevents the dog from pulling, and forces the dog to stop pulling.

The behaviorist explained that the regular harnesses that we had been using require the leash to be attached over the dogs back, which actually encourages dogs to pull.  And we already knew that regular neck collars caused our dogs to pull.  The Easy Walk harnesses were great, giving us complete control over our dogs on walks, which is extremely important when you are the owner of a big scary looking dog!  Owners of smaller breed dogs and the \"cuter\" breeds like labs and goldens, expect Bullmastiff and other scary breed owners to be in complete control of their dogs, even when their own \"cute\" dogs are completely out of control!Last summer we got a new Bullmastiff puppy, and needless to say, she has been wearing an easy walk harness on walks from the very first day we brought her home at 9 weeks old!  We knew we couldn't begin her training soon enough since she will grow up to be a very big, very scary looking dog to most people.  In December, when she was six months old, I took her to obedience class, which was comprised of all puppies her age, but they were all the cuter breeds, labs, goldens, and toy breeds.  Over the course of the class, the trainer fitted every puppy in class, except Molly, with HEAD HALTERS (like this:Sporn Pet Head Halter, Medium, Black) so that their owners could FINALLY gain control of them while walking them.  When the other puppy parents questioned why they couldn't use an EASY WALK HARNESS, like Molly, the trainer explained that since Molly already responded extremely well to the harness, she could continue using it, and she didn't need a head halter!  Needless to say, I was really proud of both of us!!I do recommend that before you buy your first harness, go to the Manufacturer's web site and double check the sizes, and be sure to measure your dog before choosing a size.  I liked ordering from Amazon, because the half sizes are more readily available here than at the pet stores, but it can be difficult to get the right size, especially for a growing puppy. Molly started out with a sm/m then graduated quickly to a medium, which didn't last long, then to med/large, which lasted her several months, and now she has graduated to a large at 8 months old.

She is excited twenty four hours a day, and lucky for me, she gets even more excited when she goes for a walk. Walking my puppy used to be a nightmare (well, it still is, a little bit). On her old harness, she could pull me down the street, no problem, and at the end of our walks my hand felt like it had lost circulation. More disconcertingly though, with her old harness, she was able to wiggle around and almost get out of it. She can run much faster than I can, so if she ever gets out of her harness, I might never see her again.I knew I needed to find her a better harness, and I found this one. I was a little worried that this would be a waste of money, because I imagined that having the leash dangling in front of her legs would distract and annoy her, but I decided to try it, because I just could not stand the pulling, and this harness claims to remedy that.In the beginning, she was a DREAM. I loved walking her because any time she started to pull, the harness would work its magic, and voila! I have the perfectly behaved puppy. But when she gets really excited (e.g. when she sees a bird, or a dog, or person, or a balloon, etc., etc.), the harness does not have as great an effect. I notice that even in these moments of ultra excitement, she's not as bad as she was without the harness, but she's still not perfect. I also notice that the effect has somewhat diminished over time. I've had this harness for about two months now, and she goes on walks every day, twice a day. While her pulling still isn't as bad before the harness, in the beginning of our walks she does exert a lot of pressure. Plus, this doesn't get my dog to walk at my side. She still walks ahead. Not that this is a big deal. My dog's a big, fluffy wacko. I don't think she'll ever be perfect on her walks, but I love her anyway.Fortunately, this harness eliminates the worry that she's going to escape. Despite all her wiggling, I have not seen her come close to getting loose from the harness (even when she pulls backward). Also, I love the fact that there are buckles for the bottom strap and the one that wraps around her chest. This harness is so easy to put on. I usually leave the one that wraps around her chest buckled all the time, and just slip this over her head, and then bend down and buckle and bottom strap (the one that goes behind her front paws. I no longer have to turn her harness around and around, trying to figure out how to put it on, and I don't have to stick her paws in (which takes forever because she always takes them back out and gets tangled).Overall, I think this is a great harness. It's not perfect, and does not eliminate all pulling.

My dog doesn't constantly pull on a flat collar but he is a very powerful dog so I thought with him I could on occasion throughout some walks see how this harness works any differently than a standard Y harness, a flat collar, prong and Gentle Leader type.I got the harness and it seems to be well made with good nylon, hardware and buckles.  The Large size fits my dog at its maximum size.  My dog is 75lbs but has a large chest.Walking with the harness, my dog will slow or stop with a little pressure even if I'm not queing him by stopping myself. The harness seems to communicate the slow and stop better than a Y harness which the dog has to figure out whether you want him to stop or pull harder (my dog carts, bikes, and ski-jores in a Y harness but will also walk in one).  I can see how this harness would be useful for walking but not for pulling anything, but pulling is under-rated.There is no practical way to give a good positive punisher (correction) to the dog with this harness.  That's true about any harness.  So if you use positive punishers in your training, you will need a collar with a second line or tab or a remote.  There's lots of pet owners that don't use positive punishment or won't have any reason to use it on a walk.So the only thing I don't like is how the lead has to wrap around his shoulder and it will chaffe him after a while.  Since the martingale strap pulls out a little, the bronze lead snap rubs on him.  Maybe if the dog was lagging a little behind the handler then the lead wouldn't wrap across the shoulder but then the dog is basically walking with a totally loose lead or being pulled by the handler.  You could train your dog to walk in that lagging position but this harness won't create the behavior.  I think most people using this will have the lead wraped across the dog's front leg.I like the Herm Sprenger prong collar, especially in the smaller sizes even for big dogs.  I've used it on my own neck and leg and I'm satisifed it can be used in a very humane way and that it is far less likely to cause the painful injury that choke chains can cause.  The evenly distributed pressure of the prongs around the neck when pressure is put on the lead using the live ring works better than anything I have tried (I use it for pressure not corrections; it's good for corrections on very hard dogs but too much for soft dogs).  The sensitivity of the dog's neck to pressure from the prong collar is why I would absolutely never want to use it unless I was actively training my dog.  Any other use is going to desensitize his neck.  I know some people will use the big (less effective than small) prong collars just to keep their dog from pulling on walks.  This is killing the neck's sensitivity slowly, toughening it up so that you'll never be able to use it to steer the dog in training.  That's why I love harnesses for puppies (just let them pull), and harnesses for just walking the dog.  That's why I see this harness as useful, and for people who don't want the adult dog to pull so much it's maybe better than a Y harness, but otherwise less useful overall.I rated it \"OK\" (3 stars) because the lead rubs the dog's shoulder, and it's less useful overall than a standard Y harness.

The weather was nice that day and there were lots of bikers out, because he tried it again about a half hour later when another biker rode past.

I have a 100 lb malamute who is now 11 and a bit senile. I have always had trouble walking her, as she likes to eat little dogs for breakfast, and medium sized dogs for lunch. In the past, I tried the gentle leader with her, which I use with my other dogs, but she decided that the way to make me stop using it, is when we cross the street, right in the middle of the street, she would immediately roll over, especially if she saw a car was coming, and attempt with all her might to get the gentle leader off. After several times of stopping traffic, I decided to order this instead.Fitting it was simple, the strap that is a different color makes for very easy identification of which way to put it on, and walking my malamute is super simple. She does not mind it one bit, actually, she seems to really like it. Even if she sees a small dog in a fenced yard, I am able to maintain full control, and with only one hand! I don't remember the last time I've been able to walk the malamute so simply, I don't think I ever have. So far I have not seen any evidence of skin irritation or anything like that, but then she has a lot of fur.I did also try this on my 85 lb short haired German Shepherd dog, who walks just fine with the gentle leader, and I decided that I prefer this over the gentle leader, and will be ordering a couple more for my other dogs. Overall a great design, great product, very happy, and so are my dogs.Update 08/12/12I wanted to send an update as I have completely switched to using this harness over the gentle leaders.

We do a lot of hiking, and one of my German Shepherds has always been a problem when it came to squirrels running in front of him that he really wants to chase. Well, this thing does the trick. After doing a few 180's with out any harm to me, he quickly learned that I have full control, and he stopped trying to chase squirrels when on leash!!About the only problem I have found, is that when the dogs try to jump in the back seat of a full size pick up truck, they have a little trouble because of the harness, and I have to help them, but this too was a blessing in disguise because now I get to decide when I'm ready for them to jump in.I'm extremely happy with this harness.

Reilly (his name) is the most docile dog in the house you will ever meet.  On a regular collar in the house he heels, stops and sits, stays and obeys all the other commands a good dog will follow. However, 3 feet out the front door on a regular collar and leash and he forgot who I am and just wouldn't listen. No amount of scolding or treats would change his behavior. Pound for pound he is one heck of a strong dog.  So much so that with a regular collar, he dragged my 82 year old father to the ground.To make matters worse my neighborhood has an abundance of friendly deer and squirrels.  Of course, he wants to chase everyone he encounters. I first went with a choke collar and he laughed that off.  He would still strain and get up on his hind legs while I held the leash and yelled NO.Next on the list was the Easy Leader. After going through a lot of trouble to put this on (he learned quickly it wasn't something he would like), it worked to a degree. The frustration with this device came soon after we started a walk. He would try to rub his face against my leg, stop and attempt to push it off his face with his front paws or go pushing his face along the ground.  Also, there were a couple of times that he would still strain at the leash regardless of the pressure being applied to have him stop.Finally, running out of hope of ever enjoying a walk, I purchased the Easy Walk.  I purchased the large dog size and had to adjust it to the lowest limits of the straps. The first thing I noticed was that he didn't resist it being fitted or snapped closed. It is easy to put on over his head and snapping the under chest strap is a breeze.  I am a fairly large guy and have no problem with the size of the buckles.  The buckles also are designed to snap only in one direction.  So if by accident you gave the under chest strap a half twist while putting it on the dog it will not snap. Removing the harness is a one hand two finger exercise.  When I take it off, he doesn't even shake himself.From his first walk with the Easy Walk he became the dog I wanted. Although he will give the deer and squirrels an occasional bark, he no longer pulls and strains.  He immediately stops when I stop, doesn't rear up and all this is accomplished while barely holding onto the leash.I recommended this to my neighbor that has an unruly 115 pound sheep dog.

The current Mal is 3-year old Giant Mal, 30\" at the shoulder, 54\" long, a trim 160 lbs. He requires the girth (belly band) of the Extra-Large harness due to his deep chest, but his shoulders remain narrow yet, and the Extra-Large shoulder strap (with the chest pull ring), is too wide even at it's smallest adjustment. The Large harness fits his chest well, but the belly band is way too short for him. So, I purchased the Large Easy-Walk, about a 24\" piece of webbing to match the existing belly band, removed the original belly band and made a direct copy re-using the original strap's hardware, but one and a half times as long. Any household sewing machine with upholstery thread and an upholstery needle will suffice. Just match the stitches and you're good to go. This Giant Mal pulls like a locomotive (no walking manners or training), but is easily handled using an Easy Walk. Be kind to yourself, daughter and I have Malamutes, Siberians and Shepards... they all wear an Easy Walk. We take our dogs for walks, the dogs do not take us for a walk (or worse).I purchased this Easy Walk Harness as a replacement for a heavy-duty web harness worn by my Malamute (extra-large, 120 lbs, large barrel/girth, yada yada). I also bought it because its a) easy to put on, b) easy to adjust, c) works great, d) cost is great, and e) I purchased one some years ago for my Siberian.As with any harness, you'll need to do some fitting, took me about 15 minutes, and another 2 minutes a day later. Do the obvious: if the dog walks out of it, make it smaller; it if chaffs, make it larger. Otherwise, consult a dog professional if you need help figuring this out.When walking casually and allowing my dogs some freedom, I put their harnesses on with the metal loop ON TOP; when I want to walk them in more crowded environments and not allow them to pull or charge off, I put the metal ring ON THE CHEST, as prescribed in the literature. The chest attachment keeps them from turning me into a human sled, they walk quietly or end up falling down on their side. They learn fast.ps: Dec 2012; We just adopted another very large Malamute (again), and bought our third Easy-Walk. At 135 lbs, this XL harness fits and still has some adjustment remaining. I think a 150 lb Mal is about the limit of this harness, fit may vary depending on your dog and breed.pss: I finally learned an obvious trick -- adjust the harness with the lead/leash ring on the chest, as intended. Then, ADD a simple round metal ring on the top strap, the strap that passes over the withers (it has a buckle to accomplish this addition). I use a 2-inch diameter ring often found at hardware stores.Why do this?, well, so that you always put the harness on the same way every time, and the additional ring on top allows you to connect your lead to it whenever and wherever you want. A 2-inch ring slides freely along this top strap. And, if you have 2 heavy haulers as I do, you can use these top rings for attaching a splitter, aka, a dog-to-dog yoke, and connect your lead to the splitter. (A splitter should have a fixed ring or similar lead attach hardware in the center.)

Brockmeier \"BofP\"", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewText": "Normally, I prefer to train a dog to walk well on a leash over relying on hardware. But I have a hard-pulling foster dog and not enough time to train her, so I purchased this after seeing some friends have great results with it. I quickly discovered that it's tricky and may not work with every dog.First problem is getting the fit right so that the front-fastening loop sits high enough on the dog's chest, because if it sits too low the \"stretching\" you get with the loop can cause the leash to hit the dogs front leg with every step. It's quite annoying for me and possibly for the dog as well. But if you tighten too much to get the fastening assembly to sit higher and not stretch out so much, it seems uncomfortably tight on the dog and looks like it's cutting into her underarms. So getting the fit right seems to be a long process of trial and error and tightening or loosening the four places you can tighten or loosen. I've had to stop in the middle of walks and start fiddling because I'm too annoyed to let it continue.There is a slight decrease in the amount of pulling she does in this harness, but I'm in the process of trying to decide which is more annoying: a dog who pulls like a tractor or trying to get this stupid %$&#@* harness to fit right.I really think that the harness would work better for my dog without the loop assembly at the fastener. I understand that the idea is for pulling to cause the harness to gently squeeze the dogs chest and exert some calming pressure, but my foster dog seems to be part freight train and doesn't seem to notice the squeezing. The only thing that seems to make the pulling less annoying is that the leash fastens in the front, so when she pulls the slight sideways pressure reduces the amount of force she can use to drag me along with her.I have a Gentle leader head harness that I used on another foster, and I think I'll try it on this one. But mostly I'm going to make time to actually train this dog how to walk nicely (see the Kikopup channel on YouTube for great leash-walking training tips--it won't let me post a link here) so I don't keep wasting my money on crappy harnesses that promise what they can't deliver.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Probably not the panacea you are hoping for", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011"}

Was a very big deal that he wasn't choking himself on the entire walk like he usually is when his leash is just attached to his regular collar. He's the worst when we first start our walk because he's so excited to get out and get going, but right out the door he did NOT pull! It was amazing!

I like the concept of the front clipping harness.  It works ok with my 80+ pounder.  I like to clip the leash to the harness ring AND the collar for extra security.

The few times that I've had to redirect him, this harness definitely worked better than if I had the leash attached only to his collar.  And it's certainly safer for the dog than a pinch collar, which I've used in the past.CONS:  The nylon is not friendly on skin and dogs (with short coats especially) can get serious chaffing on their bellies and armpits - to the point of raw skin.  If you do get this harness, I would recommend also buying the \"strap wrap\" from Pet Expertise, or sewing one of your own if you're handy like that.  It's basically soft fleece with velcro that you can use to cover the strap that goes under the belly.

I have the red version with the black under belly strap, so it's easy to tell at a glance which end of the harness is up.The collar is easy to set-up and there is a small pamphlet that shows the way to achieve a proper fit.  Getting it fit for my ~25 pound Wheaton Terrier was quickly done in about 5 minutes, and only needed some additional small adjustments over the course of the first day using it.  I purchased the medium size, as my dog was sort of in between the small and medium, and I'd rather it be a bit too big than too small.  It does fit her well, but I found that the strap for the part of the collar you attach the leash to would loosen as we walked.  To remedy this I tightened the front strap completely so that the seam on the end of the straps was pulled through the claps.  This took some work, but as a result they don't loosen anymore.  I was only able to do this since my dog is the smallest breed that will fit the medium size, I doubt I would have been able to pull them as tightly if she was bigger.In use this harness is a wonder.  As soon as I put it on my dog and we started our walk I noticed she was walking at a more relaxed pace and if she attempted to run off after another animal she was quickly stopped in her tracks.

I have a medium sized dog which has A LOT of energy and he ALWAYS wants to pull and dart off after lizards, squirrels, etc. We have begun walking a few miles a day and I realized that anything over 10min was getting annoying with all the pulling as it takes him at least an hour to calm down enough to stop pulling. I tried this harness and was surprised to see \"immediate results\". I will start off by saying that it does not fit my dog exactly like it is supposed to meaning around the torso it's a perfect fit but around the chest it's supposed to be able to let you put about 1-2 fingers underneath but after adjusting the straps, my dog has too much space (the small was too small so it had to be a medium). Regardless of this, I've seen a big improvement and the first time he lunged at something, he was somewhat \"confused\" and I barely felt the tug. I can now let the leash loose and have him smell and do his business without fear of pulling as well as walk for 45+ minutes without being annoyed at the constant yanking. He is enjoying our walks and so am I which in turn makes me want to go out more often. I wish I would've tried this years ago! Also, I did notice at first there was a small rash on the underside of my dogs front leg (just on one side) but I put a little neosporin on it, let it heal and it hasn't happened again.

Another dog, small children, or odd smells turn him into a nightmare on a leash, though. He's an incredibly strong dog when he starts pulling.A little over a year ago when he hit his first birthday, I enrolled him in some search-and-rescue training classes.  He loved it; but his enthusiasm for following the scent made the typical collar/leash ensemble a misery for both of us.  I was dragged along behind and he was gagging because of the collar pulling against his throat.  The instructor recommended this specific harness for my pooch.  He felt that conventional harnesses wouldn't work for two reasons.  One, they're bad for the skeletal structure of the dog since they force a splaying of the front legs; and, two, they actually provide the dog with additional leverage for their pulling.  He assured me that the Easy Walk harness would work much better.I ordered the Easy Walk harness for my guy and the results were amazing.  Unlike with a regular leash where my dog would tend to pull harder once he had the pressure of his collar pulling on his neck...with the Easy Walk, the pressure or pulling is centered on the front of his chest.  And, for whatever reason, it worked...he doesn't like to pull when he's wearing it.  It's easy to put on my dog and I can still leave his regular neck collar in place since he has his tags and ID on it.  It doesn't get in the way of the Easy Walk harness.The only downside that I've found with it is when I'm walking both of my dogs on retractable leashes.  On a short leash in side-by-side walking, the harness works fine.  However, when the dogs are at the full 16' extension of their retractable leashes, it becomes awkward with the leash connecting to the center of the chest.

Unless I stop and adjust it, my dog just gets used to the discomfort of the tension on his tender parts and continues to pull.  That annoyance and the fact that he hates to have the harness put on him -- and the pink skin I see in his armpits after a walk-- has led me to conclude that this is not for him.

I was using a regular collar on him but he would pull and would go after other dogs on walks. He also developed a habit of barking when I got to a house that he knew had a dog. So, even if other dogs were not barking at him if he remembered the house he would start barking which made it hard to walk him in the morning. My dog is 30 lbs, I am over 200 so it is not like he was stronger than me. But I knew this was a bad habit of his.I got the Easy Walk in hopes it would keep him from pulling. With the Easy Harness he did get better in not pulling as much but would still pull at times. But, it did nothing to curb his lunging at dogs and bikes. It was getting frustrating walking him as he would bark at no apparent reason. If you know how to use it, this collar can be helpful in training your dog to not pull as much. But, don't expect miracles, you still need to do your part to train your dog.Fast forward 3 months to the head halter. I heard about gentle leader but was apprehensive in getting it. In putting on the gentle leader my dog did fuss and not want it on him. He would try to take it off by pawing at it and rubbing his face on bushes. It has been 5 days and still does it but he is getting used to it. Reward him with treats after so he associates as positive. So does it work? YES! But, be sure you know how to use it. Watch the DVD! it is important you don't send your dog mixed signals by keeping it tense. On our first walk the dog did pull and lunge but he did not like the feeling, especially when lunging. But on our first walk I could tell he was staying by my side much better. I did not expect it to prevent lunging but it has. I think it makes him think twice. I have taken him past houses where dogs will bark it him, in the past he would try to go to the barking but now he just whimpers and keeps walking. This produce truly is working wonders (the gentle leader).So in short, I would recommend both the Easy Walk and Gentle Leader. If you have a problem it does not hurt to try both and see which one works better for your dog. But keep in mind you have to do your part to still train your dog. These products are meant as tools. For my purpose, Gentle Leader has done wonders.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Easy Walk vs. Gentle Leader", "unixReviewTime": 1390953600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2014"}

As a result going on walks with her requires 110% of my attention as she runs ahead, stops, turns around runs the other way, stops to run under a bush, and down every single driveway..... Walks were way more work than needed to be.I had her on a regular harness and I would give her a little tug back when she would start running. She'd stop....then start running again.I have used this same easy walk harness on a previous dog that I babysat for a week and it worked okay. Maybe after more time we would have seen more results. I also paid $30 for it at Pet Food Express....Quick note on measuring/sizing, my dog was 16 inches around her chest. Which is right between the xs and small. I went with the small and it works much better. I suggest going with the bigger size if you run into the same problem. They are adjustable, so you can make it smaller, but you can't make a too small size bigger.I ordered this one about a week ago and paid $14 on Amazon for the small black version. It takes a bit to get it adjusted which can be frustrating with a squirmy dog like mine, but once we got it on correctly it was pretty easy. Also, the fact that I left the instructions on the ground and my dog decided to rip them up didn't help either....I found the instructions confusing, basically to get it on there are 3 parts. 2 black and 1 other color (mine was silver). The 2 black: 1 has the easy walk logo on it, that goes behind the dog's head around the shoulders, the other has the metal loop you attach the leash to, that goes in front of the dog's chest/legs. The silver goes behind the dog's legs under the chest. I always unclip the silver then put it on with the black loops still clipped.The instructions are helpful for troubleshooting the fitting, the basic concept is fitted snuggly around the shoulders & chest, and loosely in front of the legs.After I got it on her and adjusted it. I took her for a walk to see how it would go. It was instant results! She ran ahead a little bit, but when I gave her a little pull back and causes her to stop. The placement of the ring you attach the leash to is the secret to the magic. Because the leash attaches in front of her chest, the rest of the leash hangs on either side of her body instead of straight down her back like a normal harness. If she pulls, the leash will pull her to her left or right, which turns her around to face you. The side to side pull screws up her balance which she doesn't like at all.To be fair she is fairly uncoordinated, she's in the awkward gangly teenage stage. The other dog I tried this with was 3 years old and very agile. It didn't work nearly as well. I highly suggest trying it if you have a curious puppy like dog like mine, it's also the perfect time in their developement to teach them what loose leash walking is all about.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Instant Results for one dog, okay results for another", "unixReviewTime": 1389830400, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2014"}

Being a front-attachment type harness, Easy Walk turns your pet towards you when she tries to pull away, and I've seen this in action myself.

(Short, that is, of a prong collar, which I really do NOT want to use.) Disappointed! She stills pulls, and I have absolutely no problem with the leash drooping even half an inch. However, it's true that she seems to pull less brutally, because if she pulled the tiniest bit possible harder, she'd be turning towards me due to the way the leash is attached at the front. So, in short, it may ease your pain but it's not a miracle anti-pull cure for all dogs. Re: SIZING: this harness runs small. The medium on my 42-43 pound girl just barely fits, fully extended. We probably would be better off with a Large, and she is not a big dog in the least. Fit is extremely important, and I'd guess that all the people complaining about sores under their dogs' front legs are using too small a size.

We considered getting a regular harness - except we know that a regular harness that latches in the back actually exacerbates pulling in your dog, except it would mostly stop the choking issue.  UNTIL - Our puppy trainer recommended a front-lead harness as such!Literally the first day we put it on we noticed the difference.  It doesn't prevent our dog from walking in front of us like some of the other reviewers miraculously witnessed - but it definitely stopped the pulling, choking, and coughing!

Use this with a regular lead.I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!  When used appropriately, it is a very effective aid for good leash-walking behaviors with your dog.The sizing guide for the dog's girth is pretty accurate:The Petite fits my 3.5-lb yorkie.

We will see if we need another size when he's an adult!*One minor negative (not a dealbreaker, just need more supervision) - my Aussie as a puppy would sometimes get his lower jaw stuck in the little loop in the front of the harness.  This loop provides a little too much slack that when he attempted to chew it he would just get his jaw stuck and make him frantic.  The solution?  Puppy supervision (as always) - and stop him before it starts!

Although the small size should fit a dog even a little larger than my dog, I had a hard time even getting it to fit her.The rings by Pixel's shoulders seemed to sit too far forward and looked like they would just rub on her legs. After adjusting the chest strap to its maximum length, I was happy (enough) with the fit that I can use it without feeling like it's hurting her. (I still wouldn't take her on a long hike wearing the harness--I think it would start to rub on her shoulders too much.) BUT, putting the chest strap at maximum length to get the shoulder rings back far enough creates a problem of the chest strap sagging in the front. When the chest strap sags, Pixel can manage to get her leg over it and escape the harness.I have fixed the problem with the fit by leaving Pixel's collar on when I take her out with the harness. I hook the leash onto the ring on the harness and onto the ring on her collar. This holds the chest strap up enough that even when it sags, it won't slip down and allow her to get her leg over it.My second complaint with the Easy Walk Harness is that all of the straps tend to loosen, and you have to keep readjusting them. I've thought about adjusting the straps and sewing them in place.Although I'm disappointed that the harness doesn't fit as well as it should, it does stop her from pulling!

I researched no-pull harnesses for days and decided on this one based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Now I have used the harness regularly for over a week, I cannot give it more than 3 stars - here's why:(1) Annoying to fit. I knew this before I bought it, but seriously, I spent a good hour trying to fit it just perfectly.(2) The straps get loose after you use it one to two times, so you have to refit the harness often.(3) The harness decreases pulling but does not make my dog walk like an angel by any means. (side note: we are going to puppy classes which has helped somewhat.) The first times she lunged at a couple other dogs, she fell on her face, flipped over, and kept tripping on the leash. While I suppose that could deter her from lunging, it was an unpleasant experience. The other dog owners were questioning why I was letting her be so destructive to herself, but I really had no control over it. She was in the zone where no amount of food or instruction would help. She does not pull to this extreme anymore, but she knows just how much she can pull without getting into that sort of trouble.(4) Probably the most disappointing of it all - CHAFFING. It was my fault that I continued to use the harness after I thought I noticed it was making her belly/armpits lose hair, but I honestly wasn't sure. She didn't seem to hurt or be bothered by the harness and she has pretty short, thin hair on her chest/armpits/belly. Then yesterday evening, after a number of long walks and going to puppy training class, I noticed she had quarter-sized raw areas under her armpits! I was horrified! This apparently is a common problem with this harness.I like that this harness did discourage lunging and pulling hard, as compared to my other traditional harness which seemed to encourage pulling...

Think about it, your dog is finally obeying you and heeling with respect but is constantly hit the the clip since it's just dangling there. You can't keep a tight leash because that will also tighten the harness and make it uncomfortable to walk. My solution, although it specifically says it is not recommended in the manual, is using a flexi leash. The retraction keeps a little pressure on the leash so the clip doesn't bounce around but not so much pressure that it tightens the harness.

Just like the picture of this product, I have a Weimaraner.  She's four months old, 37lbs, and a bundle of energy.  She loves going for walks and I'm trying to get her better with the leash, but it's hit or miss.  Sometimes she's good, but if she gets excited (which she does A LOT), sees another dog, or any random person, she lunges and jumps.  She's literally getting stronger by the week and getting harder to control.  I can't attach her leash to her collar; she doesn't seem to realize she's choking herself and causing raw marks around her neck.  I've tried the head harness, but that was a complete failure from the start.  I refuse to put choke chains on my dogs so I began trying harnesses.  Even those were giving her rub burns from pulling, even the Kong brand comfort harness.  After seeing this and reading the reviews, I decided to try this out.  The sizing chart was accurate.  The deep purple color matches perfectly with the collar she already has (and, might I say, looks gorgeous on her coat).  I had to adjust it to pretty much its smallest size, but that's ok since she's still growing and can grow into this.  Putting harnesses on her has always been more a two-person job.  She fidgets and bites and can't sit still to save her life.  I guess because this harness has only 3 straps instead of the usual 4, it was actually easier to slip on her.  She immediately started chewing on the front, even before I clasped it shut.  I'm hoping it'll hold up to her chewing; I'll update this later when she's worn it longer.  After leaving it on her for 30-some minutes, I decided to take it out for a spin.  It IMMEDIATELY had results.  She usually pulls and lunges right out the door, and a split second after she tried with this harness on, she felt the pressure of it across her front and stopped.  We walked out the front door at a nice calm pace, which she's only ever done when she was half asleep.  We got outside and throughout our entire walk there was no pulling.  At all.  That has literally never happened with her before.  As soon as she'd attempt to pull, she'd stop and there were a few times where she'd stop and turn to look at me, like she knew I finally won this battle.  Walking with her was an absolute joy.  She walked beside me the whole time and didn't try to run off after the neighborhood kids or my neighbors walking their dogs like she usually does.  I'll definitely update this after we've had it for another month or so just to give a better review on its durability with a dog who loves to chew, but so far I am absolutely ecstatic over this purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best.

Since the photo showed it on a weimaraner I thought it might work. However it ended up not working well on him. He did not mind wearing it at all to him it was just another harness unfortunately he had the same felling when he wore it. He is not a constant puller, he only pulls/lunges when he sees something he wants to chase or someone he wants to say hi too. However being a big dog a lot of people do not appreciate him running up to them and I can't blame them because they don't know he is friendly. His other problem is sometimes wants to jump up on things like walls along sidewalks and anything higher than him. Now I did not figure it would help with the jumping just the prep run before the jump. Unfortunately I have a stubborn dog that did not care if the harness pinched up in the front he just kept pulling till he got to what he wanted.  Then he figured out if he turned so he was facing me and pulled backwards he could pull right out. You can imagine what trouble that causes. Luckily for me he was pulling because he wanted to say hi to the neighbor's dogs on the way home so I was able to catch him. I have heard from others that it works great for their dogs and I have seen it work I just can't trust it on my dog. I can still use it but I now clip the leash to his collar and the harness.

The harness alone does not make my dog walk nicely but coupled with training my 9month old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel went from practically tearing up the ground and hurting my arm to walking like a pro!! We switched to this harness from a mesh harness and I was worried that this one would be uncomfortable for him but he seems just as comfortable in it as the other one if not more so. It is not bulky (so its great for the hot summer) and extremely easy to put on once you figure it out compared to other harnesses I have used. Also, this harness unlike some others does not seem to put any pressure on the neck in either the front or back.About the sizing: I have a 17 pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who is 9 months old and the tweener small/medium size is slightly big on him. When I tighten the harness to the tightest it will go it fits pretty good but still ever so slightly loose so if you have a dog around this size I would recommend getting a small.What helped our seemingly helpless leash-pulling dog walk like a pro:1. Stand up straight with good posture (this posture shows that you are leader - dogs react to body language)2. Walk and think confidently. While strong and confident, also remain relaxed, patient, and in good spirits (dogs are good at picking up on our emotional state.3. Hold the leash short but loose with a relaxed arm and shoulder.4. Make sure your dog is either at your side or behind you when walking and if he is pulling don't give in, only allowing him to be at your side until he gets the picture.5. Don't let him stop and sniff or go to the bathroom on his own terms - being able to do so is a reward and should only be done when told to by you.6. The walk should be much longer than the time that he gets to sniff around to show that you are the leader.7. Have your dog sit/wait upon opening the door and walking outside, allowing you to exit the house first and likewise have your dog sit/wait before entering the house, allowing you to be the first one in the house showing that you are the leader.8. Always bring treats with you on walks that you can easily stick in your pocket and use for rewarding for good behavior. Along with treats, praise and encourage your dog verbally and/or petting when they are doing what you want them to do! The first few times they walk nicely - reward them immediately. But as they start walking the way you want on a regular basis, treats can become more infrequent and eventually only one treat when they get back from the walk. You can also use treats on walks in other situations such as when they see a person or and don't bark, sit/stay still when you are picking up their poop, etc.9. Don't give up! How quickly and effectively get results may surprise you! If they are used to leading and pulling it may take some time but I promise that working on it for a few days to a few weeks to get them under control is definitely worth the time and effort. Our dog seemed to be completely hopeless after trying all kinds of methods we tried on our own and with limited research but after I did more research and followed these tips, he now walks like a \"normal\" well-behaved dog!10. Once you get the walk down (it will take practice and consistency), they will start to view you as the leader and trust you more which may even help with other issues like anxiety, barking, etc.10. If you have been consistent in trying these steps or others and your dog still pulls on the leash while walking - in my opinion it would be worth either taking your dog to some training classes offered in your area or hiring a trainer to come to your house as walks should be pleasant for both you and your dog, not stressful. And it doesn't get better on its own without intervention of some kind whether from you and whoever else takes care of the dog or a trainer. A few weeks of training will be worth years of peaceful walking.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love this Harness.", "unixReviewTime": 1342569600, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2012"}

I intentionally sought out a lower price because after all, who doesn't want to save money where they can, and because I was leery that this harness wouldn't work.  That being said it is made well and after a few days of using it, I feel like I got it at a steal.  I love my pups other harnesses because of their look and security features but even though my dog is only 8 lbs, he can pull hard. His past harnesses did nothing to help him stop pulling.  I tried using treats to subdue the behavior but he is so excited to go for a walk that he doesn't care about treats.  His walks are treats.  He pulls so much that he will walk at least a block on his back legs, like a person.  This harness is definitely correcting the behavior.  On our first walk with it he pulled a couple times, slowed down and started walking by my side, actually walking like a dog instead of a furry little human.  Several times I noticed after every four or five of my steps he would look over at me to see where I am like out of an episode the dog whisperer.  I can't say this will work for everyone but so far my experience is very positive.The most difficult thing about the harness is getting the fit right.  Using the measurement guide I wasn't sure if my dog needed petite, or petite/small, so after measuring him a couple times he fell in between the measurements of both harnesses.  So I went with the lager one.  The petite/small is a \"tween size\"  a tad larger than the petite, but smaller than the small.  I am glad I went with the tween because there isn't much room for error in the sizing.  There is maybe about two inches of room to grow on the belly strap, an inch on the top strap and it could have been a little smaller on the front strap that crosses the chest.  But since he is only 9 months old he may still need a little room to grow.  So I feel better having the larger harness.  I adjusted it to his body per the instructions that comes with the harness and the fit is pretty good.Worth a try for those who love the security of a harness but dislike choke chains.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Measure Twice", "unixReviewTime": 1375833600, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2013"}

The material is also of the hard and abrasive variety - possibly nylon - with no padding, which worries me that my short-haired dog would eventually lose hair or chafe under her arms with extended use. Also, this may be due to none-ideal sizing but I found that the Martingale loop, as opposed to a centered loop on the front strap itself, caused my dog to walk at an angle instead of forwards. To rectify this I connected the lead to both the Martingale loop and the loop of her collar, which makes me wonder why it wasn't just designed that way to begin with.I can see where the harness has the potential to help deter pulling but I never got around to fully seeing that come into fruition.

They've all reduced pulling in various degrees, and they keep my dog from choking himself while trying to pull, so they deserve praise for that alone.However, I will say I'm pretty disappointed with this product by itself. The first harness we tried (a medium) had a shoulder strap proportioned perfectly to fit around my dog, but the chest strap couldn't be tightened enough, and so even though it did prevent pulling, it was primarily because the chest strap kept falling down over my dog's legs, preventing him from moving his front legs very effectively. We decided to try another size when the strap actually caused my dog to trip and fall on some stairs. We tried a small and a small-medium, and settled on the small/medium, which proved to fit the best, though even when it seems like it should be perfectly tight, the chest strap moves up and down, restricting my beagle's leg movement.I was ready to ditch this harness and try something else, when I had the idea to leave his regular neck collar attached, and attached the leash to BOTH the harness and regular collar. By doing so, the collar keeps the chest strap of the harness from moving down, while the harness prevents pulling and doesn't allow my dog to choke himself on the regular collar. This combination has proven to be pretty much perfect for us, so I like the product, but without the additional collar, I think this product feels incomplete (at least for my dog).Every dog is shaped differently, and these harnesses seem to work great by themselves on larger dogs and smaller dogs, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt. If you have a medium dog, though, I would highly recommend trying the method I mentioned with both the collar and harness attached together- its made walking my dog a LOT more enjoyable.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good,  not perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1349740800, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2012"}

It will hold up with light chewing (like between throws) but don't expect it to withstand hours with a heavy or even moderate chewer.Material and Durability:This toy is made out of a softer rubber than other dog frisbees we've used, to give you an idea it will easily bend in half (around the ball of course) with little effort on your part, unlike other more stiff frisbees.  The rubber is thick enough that, as I said above, it will hold up to light chewing and because it is so malleable it is less likely to break off (but more likely to crack) and seems like less of a chew magnet for my dog.The ball if made of the same softer rubber and I wish it were made out of a harder rubber like the Cuz balls.  This is not nearly as durable as those Cuz balls and within a few days of playing with this the ball stopped squeaking because she had broken through the rubber (not enough to see holes but pretty much cracked it).  So the same material that, in my opinion, makes the frisbee part more durable also makes the ball less so.  My dog LOVED this thing with the squeaker in it and now that the squeaker is no more she still likes it but she's not as enthusiastic as she was before.  To be fair, she DID seem to realize the middle was a ball so she put in some effort to try to detach it to play without the frisbee part.  :)  She was unsuccessful of course but even with her attempts and her squeaking the ball in between throws I would think that the ball should be able to withstand her playing.  After all, the squeaker ball was made with the intention of the dog chewing it to make it squeak, right?While this seems perfect for a game of tug for dogs, I wouldn't recommend it.  I think a harder rubber frisbee would be able to better sustain the tugging than this.  As I said, while I think this is less likely to break of in chunks, it is more likely to crack and thus tear.Play:Like another reviewer wrote (thank you btw, it was a very helpful tip), I throw this vertically so that when it lands it will roll for a little bit.  This does not go as far as a ball even with the roll at the end.  Without it, this wouldn't be a very good fetch toy at all.  That being said, don't expect to get too much extended play even with the roll...it takes my dog less than a second to catch up with it rolling.  I guess I don't know why I expected otherwise, I mean really, how fast can a rubber frisbee roll? :)  Also, if it happens to veer off course and roll to one side it doesn't really make my dog chase after it (like another reviewer mentioned his/her dog doing).  Instead, she'll just trot after it and pick it up...it's too slow to really engage her in any kind of chase.As far as the squeaker, take into consideration if you intend to play in the yard with neighbors around.  If you've never heard a squeaker ball before, they are much louder than the squeakers in stuffed dog toys.  If your dog loves squeakers as much as mine does, each throw will be followed with laps around the yard squeaking the frisbee.  So...in a way it's almost a good thing the squeaker ball died after a few days because it is loud and I did feel a little bad for my neighbors.Misc:This is easy to clean, of course, being rubber.  My dog's favorite fetch toy in the whole world is a rope ball with a rope attached...that turns into a mud ball easily and is much harder to wash.  I definitely appreciate ease of cleaning in an outdoor toy.Overall, I was between a 3 and a 4 on this and went with the 4.  My dog likes this toy but without the squeaker this is not her favorite.

This particular set is a spectacular deal.  It claims to clean pet stains in some of the literature and it does do an adequate job at that.  But, at odor, it excels!  I have used it for multiple pet and household stains.  Here is my most dramatic case, and the one that really sold me:I adopted a &#34;retired breeder&#34; cat.  She was still intact and making very odorous urine.  I took her to the vet to be spayed.  On the way, she got frightened and urinated in her carrier.  However, the angle caused virtually all of it to pour onto my car floor.  Because, there was so much of the urine, it saturated the mat and the carpet to the sides.  I assumed that my car was ruined.  But, I had just bought this days before and gave it a try.  I followed directions, using water with it as described, and doing 2 retreats the first day.  When I returned the next day, the smell was almost gone, but not quite.  It turns out that I had missed a few spots.  I did a thorough retreat of the whole area.  Then, the next day, I checked again.  The smell was completely gone.  It has been over 3 years now, and even in the hottest, most humid days, there is NO ODOR AT ALL!So, as you can imagine, I am sold for life.Here are a few practical hints:The different size bottles have different sprayers.  The big one works for saturating stains or odors.  The little one is an aerosol.  This is a great room deodorizer.  You can also order larger bottles and refill these bottles to save money.It has a pleasant light scent, but this is designed to last only a few minutes.  After that, there is essentially no scent.  It works by removing the bad smell, not by covering it up.  You should know that there is a bleach like smell during the period when the scent breaks down.  But, it does not have a bleaching affect on colors at all.This works well when water is used with it.  Therefore, when I was running low, I tried diluting it. It actually worked well as a way to stretch the product with little loss of function.  I have repeated this several times.Remember to think of this for HUMAN toileting issues, not just pets.  The aerosol is a great bathroom deodorizer, especially if you have allergies to lots of the commercial scents.

You have to be careful and spray in a way that the deodorizer comes in contact with the entire soiled area -- which may be why it doesn't work as well if the pet urine has soaked into a cushion.  I haven't had that problem -- for my purposes, Zero Odor works just fine.I purchased this &#34;basic kit&#34; after purchasing the large bottle several times, and like having the smaller bottles to use in other parts of the house that need a quick &#34;freshen up.&#34;  This kit is a good deal considering how much you get.This is the best stuff I've found for odor removal for my cats.  Will definitely continue purchasing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Definitely works for me ....", "unixReviewTime": 1397606400, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2014"}

I tried several versions of fabreze, odor be gone, and who knows what else. This is amazing. The smaller area that didn't smell as bad now smells like she never was there. The other room which reeked, you have to have your nose just above the carpet to smell it. It does say on the bottle that deep smells can take several applications. But I really don't mind because it is already so much better and I only got it a few days ago. I still have 1/3 of the large bottle left, but I will be ordering more for other odors around the house and I might share with the rest of my family. This also works great on clothes. My rabbit peed on me, I rinsed out my jeans and used the smaller mister bottle, and no more smell. I really love this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "OMG I Love This!", "unixReviewTime": 1401148800, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2014"}
